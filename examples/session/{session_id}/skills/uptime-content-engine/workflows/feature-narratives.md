# Feature Narratives Workflow

**Creates compelling feature descriptions that sell benefits, not features.**

---

## Purpose

Features don't sell—benefits do. This workflow transforms technical capabilities into stories that prospects actually care about. Every feature narrative answers: "What problem does this solve, and why should I care?"

**Use for:**
- Landing page feature sections
- Product tour copy
- Feature comparison pages
- Sales enablement content
- App onboarding copy
- Capability highlights

---

## The Uptime Feature Formula

```
FEATURE NARRATIVE = Problem Context + Capability + Outcome + Proof
```

**Example:**
```
PROBLEM CONTEXT: You're spending weeks screening unqualified applicants.
CAPABILITY: Our AI automatically qualifies every applicant against your requirements.
OUTCOME: You only review drivers who actually fit—saving hours every day.
PROOF: Customers report 3x more qualified applicants in their pipeline.
```

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Feature

**Gather information:**
```
FEATURE NAME: [Internal/technical name]
CAPABILITY: [What it actually does]
PROBLEM IT SOLVES: [What frustration does it eliminate?]
OUTCOME: [What's different after using it?]
PROOF POINT: [Data or testimonial that proves it]
EMOTIONAL HOOK: [What feeling does resolution bring?]
```

**Example:**
```
FEATURE NAME: AI-Powered Matching
CAPABILITY: Uses machine learning to score driver-fleet compatibility
PROBLEM IT SOLVES: Hiring drivers who quit within months
OUTCOME: Higher retention, better driver-fleet fit
PROOF POINT: 90% first-year retention rate
EMOTIONAL HOOK: Relief—finally, hires that actually work out
```

---

### Step 2: Choose Narrative Length

| Context | Length | Elements |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Feature card | Short (25-40 words) | Capability + Outcome |
| Feature section | Medium (50-100 words) | Problem + Capability + Outcome |
| Feature page | Long (150-300 words) | Full narrative with proof |
| Sales deck | Variable | Adjustable per audience |

---

### Step 3: Write the Problem Context

**Start with the pain. Always.**

**Formula:**
```
[You/Your team/Fleet managers] are [frustrated verb] [painful situation].
[Current approach] [why it fails].
```

**Examples:**
```
SHORT:
"You're losing drivers faster than you can hire them."

MEDIUM:
"Your inbox is flooded with applicants who don't meet basic requirements.
Every day, you waste hours screening resumes that should never have reached you."

LONG:
"Your hiring process wasn't designed for this. Every open position means
weeks of posting to multiple job boards, reviewing hundreds of unqualified
applications, and chasing candidates who ghost you at the last minute.
Meanwhile, your trucks sit idle and your existing drivers burn out
covering the gaps."
```

**Problem context by feature:**
```
AI MATCHING:
"Half your new hires quit within the first year. You're not hiring the
wrong people—you're hiring without knowing if they'll actually fit."

AUTOMATED SCREENING:
"For every qualified applicant, you review ten that don't meet
basic requirements. That's hours lost to applicants who were never going to work."

MULTI-CHANNEL SOURCING:
"Your candidates are scattered across five job boards, your website, and
a spreadsheet. Good luck knowing where your best drivers actually came from."

14-DAY GUARANTEE:
"You've been burned before. Fancy promises, zero results. Then the invoice
arrives anyway."
```

---

### Step 4: Write the Capability Statement

**Describe what it does—clearly, specifically, simply.**

**Formula:**
```
[Uptime / Our system] [action verb] [specific capability].
[Optional: How it works in one sentence.]
```

**Examples:**
```
SHORT:
"Uptime automatically screens every applicant against your requirements."

MEDIUM:
"Our AI analyzes every application against your specific requirements—
experience, endorsements, violation history, location—and only surfaces
drivers who actually qualify."

LONG:
"Uptime's AI-powered screening engine evaluates every applicant the moment
they apply. We check CDL status, experience level, violation history,
preferred routes, and dozens of other factors against your custom
requirements. Qualified applicants move forward immediately.
Unqualified ones are filtered out before you ever see them."
```

**Capability statements by feature:**
```
AI MATCHING:
"Our matching algorithm scores every candidate against your fleet's actual
retention patterns—not just qualifications, but fit."

AUTOMATED SCREENING:
"Every applicant is automatically verified and qualified. You only see
drivers who meet your requirements."

MULTI-CHANNEL SOURCING:
"One pipeline aggregates applications from every source—job boards, your
website, referrals—into a single, organized dashboard."

REAL-TIME DASHBOARD:
"See your entire hiring pipeline at a glance. Every applicant, every stage,
every metric—updated in real time."
```

---

### Step 5: Write the Outcome Statement

**Paint the picture of life after.**

**Formula:**
```
[Result or transformation] + [specific benefit] + [emotional payoff].
```

**Examples:**
```
SHORT:
"Your trucks get back on the road in weeks, not months."

MEDIUM:
"Instead of chasing unqualified applicants, you spend your time with
drivers who actually want the job. Your first hire arrives in 14 days."

LONG:
"Your hiring transforms from a three-month ordeal into a two-week pipeline.
You stop reviewing resumes that should never have reached you. You stop
losing drivers who weren't right from the start. Your trucks run, your
team isn't burned out, and hiring becomes something that just works."
```

**Outcome statements by feature:**
```
AI MATCHING:
"90% of drivers placed through Uptime are still with their fleet after
one year. That's not luck—it's matching."

AUTOMATED SCREENING:
"You'll see 3x more qualified applicants in your pipeline. No extra
effort. Just better candidates."

MULTI-CHANNEL SOURCING:
"No more switching between platforms. No more wondering where your
best drivers came from. One system, complete visibility."

14-DAY GUARANTEE:
"If you don't have a qualified driver within 14 days, you don't pay.
Simple."
```

---

### Step 6: Add the Proof Point

**Back it up. Every time.**

**Formula:**
```
[Statistic or testimonial] + [source or context].
```

**Examples:**
```
STATISTIC:
"Customers report a 60% reduction in hiring costs within the first quarter."

TESTIMONIAL:
"'We went from 84 days to 14. I didn't think it was possible.' — Sarah Chen, VP Operations"

COMPARISON:
"Industry average time-to-hire: 84 days. Uptime average: 14 days."
```

**Proof points by feature:**
```
AI MATCHING:
- 90% first-year retention rate
- "Finally, hires that actually stay." — Fleet Manager, 50-truck operation

AUTOMATED SCREENING:
- 3x more qualified applicants in pipeline
- Customers save 10+ hours per week on screening

MULTI-CHANNEL SOURCING:
- 40% increase in applicant volume
- Single dashboard for all sources

14-DAY GUARANTEE:
- 14-day average time to first hire
- Money-back if not delivered
```

### Step 7: Assemble the Narrative

**Short format (feature card):**
```
[HEADLINE - Benefit-focused]
[Capability + Outcome in 2-3 sentences]
```

**Example:**
```
AI-Powered Matching

Find drivers who stay, not just apply. Our algorithm scores every
candidate against your fleet's retention patterns, delivering 90%
first-year retention.
```

**Medium format (feature section):**
```
[HEADLINE]

[Problem context - 1-2 sentences]
[Capability - 2-3 sentences]
[Outcome - 1-2 sentences]
[Proof point - stat or quote]
```

**Example:**
```
AI-Powered Matching

Half your new hires quit within the first year. You're not hiring
wrong—you're hiring blind.

Uptime's matching algorithm analyzes every candidate against patterns
from thousands of successful placements. We don't just check
qualifications—we score fit. Culture, route preferences, tenure
history—all factored in before you review a single application.

The result? 90% of Uptime-placed drivers are still with their fleet
after year one. That's not luck—that's matching done right.
```

**Long format (feature page):**
```
[HERO HEADLINE]
[SUBHEADLINE]

[Problem context - full paragraph]

[HOW IT WORKS SECTION]
[Capability deep-dive with specifics]

[RESULTS SECTION]
[Outcomes with multiple proof points]

[CTA]
```

---

### Step 8: Validate

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Problem first?** Opens with pain, not feature
- [ ] **Specific capability?** Clear what it actually does
- [ ] **Outcome focused?** Describes life after, not just during
- [ ] **Proof included?** Backed by data or testimonial
- [ ] **Uptime voice?** Direct, confident, not salesy
- [ ] **Jargon-free?** Anyone can understand it
- [ ] **Appropriate length?** Matches the context
- [ ] **CTA clear?** (if applicable) Obvious next step

**Great feature narratives don't describe what you built. They describe what changes for the customer.**
