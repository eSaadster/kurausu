## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Post

**Gather information:**
```
PLATFORM: [LinkedIn / Twitter / Instagram]
CONTENT TYPE: [Insight / Data / Story / Question / Announcement]
KEY MESSAGE: [The one thing readers should take away]
GOAL: [Engagement / Awareness / Traffic / Lead gen]
VISUAL: [Image / Carousel / Video / None]
```

**Example:**
```
PLATFORM: LinkedIn
CONTENT TYPE: Data insight
KEY MESSAGE: The true cost of empty seats is higher than you think
GOAL: Engagement and awareness
VISUAL: Data card showing $1,200/day
```

---

### Step 2: Write the Hook

**The first line determines if anyone reads the rest.**

**Hook formulas:**
```
THE PROVOCATIVE STATEMENT:
"Your ATS is a $50,000/year suggestion box."

THE SURPRISING STAT:
"$1,200. That's what every empty seat costs you. Per day."

THE QUESTION:
"What if everything you know about the 'driver shortage' is wrong?"

THE CONTRARIAN:
"Unpopular opinion: Sign-on bonuses are making your retention worse."

THE STORY STARTER:
"Three years ago, our trucks sat idle for months at a time."

THE DIRECT ADDRESS:
"Fleet managers, we need to talk about your hiring costs."
```

**Hook rules:**
```
- First line stands alone (line break after)
- No filler words ("I wanted to share...")
- Specific > General
- Provoke curiosity or challenge assumption
```

---

### Step 3: Write LinkedIn Posts

**Structure for long-form LinkedIn:**
```
[HOOK - 1 line that stops the scroll]

[Line break]

[CONTEXT - 2-3 sentences setting up the problem/insight]

[Line break]

[MAIN CONTENT - 3-5 short paragraphs or bullet points]

[Line break]

[TAKEAWAY - What to do with this information]

[Line break]

[CTA - Soft ask: question, comment prompt, or link]
```

**Example post:**
```
$1,200.

That's what every empty driver seat costs you. Per day.

Not the recruiting costs. Not the job board fees. The daily cost
of trucks sitting idle while you search for drivers.

Here's what most fleets miss when calculating hiring costs:

→ Vacancy cost: $1,200/day per empty seat
→ Overtime for existing drivers covering gaps
→ Delayed shipments and missed contracts
→ Customer relationships at risk

Add it up. A 90-day hiring process for one driver costs ~$108,000
in vacancy costs alone.

The industry average time-to-hire? 84 days.

This isn't a recruiting problem. It's a math problem.

What's your true cost-per-hire when you include vacancy costs?

[Link to blog post in comments]
```

**LinkedIn formatting tips:**
```
- Use line breaks liberally (creates white space)
- Bullet points or → arrows for lists
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Emojis sparingly (one per section max, if any)
- CTA as question or soft prompt
- Link in comments, not post body
```

---

### Step 4: Write Twitter/X Posts

**Single tweet format:**
```
[Hook/Statement]
[Supporting context]
[Optional: CTA or question]

Character limit: 280
```

**Examples:**
```
STAT TWEET:
"$1,200/day. That's what every empty driver seat costs your fleet.
Not recruiting costs. Vacancy costs.
84-day hiring cycle? That's $100k+ per seat."

HOT TAKE:
"Unpopular opinion: The 'driver shortage' is actually a retention crisis.
You don't have a hiring problem.
You have a keeping problem."

QUICK TIP:
"3 interview questions that actually predict driver retention:
1. Why did you leave your last 3 positions?
2. What does a 'good' dispatcher look like?
3. What would make you quit in the first 90 days?"

ENGAGEMENT BAIT (GOOD VERSION):
"Your cost-per-hire calculation is missing 60% of your actual costs.
Reply 'CPH' and I'll explain what you're not counting."
```

**Thread starters:**
```
"We analyzed 10,000 driver placements.
Here's what actually predicts retention:
🧵"

"Your hiring process is costing you more than you think.
A thread on the hidden math of driver recruiting:
🧵"
```

### Step 5: Write Instagram Captions

**Structure:**
```
[HOOK - First line that shows in preview]

[STORY or CONTEXT - Brief but human]

[KEY POINT - The main message]

[CTA - Soft ask or prompt]

[HASHTAGS - At end or in first comment]
```

**Example:**
```
Empty seats. Parked trucks. $1,200 disappearing every single day.

That's the real cost of slow hiring. Not the job board fees.
Not the recruiter time. The trucks that aren't moving.

When we started Uptime, we asked one question:
What if hiring took 14 days instead of 84?

The math changes everything.

What's your biggest hiring frustration? Drop it below. 👇

#trucking #logistics #driverhiring #fleetmanagement
```

**Instagram tips:**
```
- First line is hook (shows in feed preview)
- Keep it conversational and human
- Use emojis naturally (not forced)
- End with question or CTA
- Hashtags at end or first comment
- Caption should enhance visual, not duplicate it
```

---

### Step 6: Write Social Ad Copy

**LinkedIn Ad Copy:**
```
PRIMARY TEXT (150 chars max):
"Your trucks are parked. Your drivers are burned out. Your hiring
takes 3 months. There's a better way."

HEADLINE (70 chars max):
"14 Days to Your First Driver. Guaranteed."

DESCRIPTION (100 chars max):
"AI-powered hiring that actually works. See the pipeline in action."

CTA: Learn More / Get Demo / See How
```

**Facebook/Instagram Ad Copy:**
```
PRIMARY TEXT:
"What if hiring a driver took 14 days instead of 84?

No more endless job board posts.
No more chasing ghosts.
No more trucks sitting idle.

Just qualified drivers, delivered fast.

See how Uptime transformed hiring for fleets like yours."

HEADLINE:
"Driver Hiring in 14 Days"

CTA: Learn More
```

### Step 7: Validate

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Hook stops scroll?** Would you stop for this?
- [ ] **Platform appropriate?** Tone and length match
- [ ] **Value provided?** Teaches, provokes, or resonates
- [ ] **Not salesy?** Value first, product second (or not at all)
- [ ] **On-brand voice?** Direct, confident, data-backed
- [ ] **Clear CTA?** (if applicable) Obvious next step
- [ ] **Visual attached?** (if applicable) Supports the message
- [ ] **Hashtags appropriate?** (Instagram) Relevant, not spammy
