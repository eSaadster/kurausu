# CTA Arsenal Workflow

**Creates calls-to-action that convert attention into action.**

---

## Purpose

A CTA is where content becomes business. Every great piece of content earns attention—the CTA directs that attention toward a specific outcome. This workflow creates CTAs that feel natural, reduce friction, and drive conversions.

**Use for:**
- Button text on landing pages
- Email CTAs
- Blog post CTAs
- Social media CTAs
- Ad CTAs
- In-app CTAs
- Form submissions

---

## The CTA Hierarchy

```
LEVEL 1: HIGH COMMITMENT
- Book a demo
- Start free trial
- Schedule a call

LEVEL 2: MEDIUM COMMITMENT
- See how it works
- Get pricing
- Talk to sales

LEVEL 3: LOW COMMITMENT
- Learn more
- Read the guide
- Watch video

LEVEL 4: MICRO COMMITMENT
- Subscribe
- Follow
- Download

Match CTA level to where prospect is in their journey.

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Context

**Gather information:**
```
PLACEMENT: [Where does this CTA appear?]
AUDIENCE STAGE: [Awareness / Consideration / Decision]
CONTENT ABOVE: [What content precedes this CTA?]
DESIRED ACTION: [What specifically should they do?]
FRICTION LEVEL: [High / Medium / Low acceptable friction]
```

**Example:**
```
PLACEMENT: Hero section of homepage
AUDIENCE STAGE: Awareness (first-time visitors)
CONTENT ABOVE: Value proposition headline
DESIRED ACTION: Book a demo call
FRICTION LEVEL: Medium (demo is significant commitment)
```

---

### Step 2: Choose CTA Type

| Context | CTA Type | Examples |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Homepage hero | Primary button | "See How It Works" |
| Feature section | Secondary button | "Learn More" |
| Blog post | Text link or soft button | "Read the full guide" |
| Email | Text link or button | "Book your call" |
| Social | Text in caption | "Link in bio" |
| Pricing page | Primary button | "Start Free Trial" |
| Exit intent | Modal button | "Wait! Get the guide first" |

---

### Step 3: Write the Button Text

**Button text formulas:**
```
THE ACTION:
"Book a Demo"
"Start Free Trial"
"Get Started"

THE OUTCOME:
"See It In Action"
"Get Your First Driver"
"Fill Your Seats"

THE BENEFIT:
"Hire Faster"
"Cut Hiring Costs"
"Stop Chasing Drivers"

THE PERSONAL:
"Show Me How"
"I'm Ready"
"Let's Talk"

THE SPECIFIC:
"Book a 15-Minute Call"
"Get Pricing for Your Fleet"
"See Uptime for [Fleet Size]"
```

**Button text rules:**
```
- 2-5 words maximum
- Start with verb
- Avoid generic ("Submit," "Click Here")
- Be specific when possible
- Match to page context
```

---

### Step 4: Write Supporting Copy

**CTA supporting copy (above or below button):**
```
REDUCING FRICTION:
"No credit card required"
"Free 14-day trial"
"Takes 2 minutes"
"No commitment"

ADDING URGENCY:
"Limited spots available"
"Offer ends [date]"
"Only [X] left"

ADDING SOCIAL PROOF:
"Join 500+ fleets"
"Trusted by [Company Names]"
"Rated 4.9/5 by fleet managers"

STATING THE BENEFIT:
"See how you can hire in 14 days"
"Discover your true cost savings"
"Get matched with qualified drivers"
```

---

### Step 5: Create CTA Pairs

**Primary + Secondary CTA:**
```
Homepage:
PRIMARY: "Book a Demo"
SECONDARY: "See How It Works"

Feature Page:
PRIMARY: "Start Free Trial"
SECONDARY: "Talk to Sales"

Pricing Page:
PRIMARY: "Get Started"
SECONDARY: "Contact Sales"

Blog Post:
PRIMARY: "Read the Full Guide"
SECONDARY: "Subscribe for More"
```

**Placement rules:**
```
- Primary CTA: Prominent, high-contrast button
- Secondary CTA: Text link or ghost button
- Primary always gets visual emphasis
- Don't let secondary compete with primary
```

---

### Step 6: Match CTA to Journey Stage

**Awareness Stage (Top of Funnel):**
```
GOAL: Education, not commitment
CTAs:
- "Learn More"
- "Read the Guide"
- "Watch the Video"
- "See How It Works"

SUPPORTING: "Free resource" / "No signup required"
```

**Consideration Stage (Middle of Funnel):**
```
GOAL: Deeper engagement
CTAs:
- "See Pricing"
- "Get a Custom Quote"
- "Book a Demo"
- "Talk to Sales"

SUPPORTING: "15-minute call" / "No pressure"
```

**Decision Stage (Bottom of Funnel):**
```
GOAL: Conversion
CTAs:
- "Start Free Trial"
- "Get Started Now"
- "Sign Up Today"
- "Activate Your Account"

SUPPORTING: "14-day free trial" / "No credit card required"
```

---

### Step 7: Validate

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Action clear?** Obvious what happens when clicked
- [ ] **Verb leads?** Button starts with action word
- [ ] **Benefit implied?** Clear value in taking action
- [ ] **Friction addressed?** Supporting copy reduces hesitation
- [ ] **Length appropriate?** 2-5 words for buttons
- [ ] **Journey-appropriate?** Matches where prospect is
- [ ] **Not generic?** Avoid "Submit," "Click Here"
- [ ] **One primary focus?** Not competing CTAs
