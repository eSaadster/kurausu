## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Email

**Gather information:**
```
EMAIL TYPE: [Newsletter / Nurture / Announcement / Re-engagement / Onboarding]
AUDIENCE: [Who receives this?]
GOAL: [What should they do after reading?]
KEY MESSAGE: [The one thing they should remember]
CTA: [Specific action to take]
POSITION IN SEQUENCE: [Standalone / Part of series - which #?]
```

**Example:**
```
EMAIL TYPE: Nurture email
AUDIENCE: Marketing qualified leads who haven't booked demo
GOAL: Get them to schedule a demo
KEY MESSAGE: Your current process is costing you more than you realize
CTA: Book a 15-minute call
POSITION IN SEQUENCE: Email 3 of 5 in nurture sequence
```

---

### Step 2: Write the Subject Line

**Subject line is everything. 47% of email recipients decide to open based on subject line alone.**

**Formulas:**
```
THE QUESTION:
"What's your real cost-per-hire?"
"Still chasing drivers?"

THE PROVOCATIVE STATEMENT:
"Your ATS is a $50k suggestion box"
"The hiring math no one talks about"

THE PERSONAL:
"Quick question about your hiring"
"[Name], this caught my attention"

THE SPECIFIC VALUE:
"5 interview questions that predict retention"
"The 14-day hiring timeline"

THE URGENCY (use sparingly):
"Your trucks are waiting"
"Before your next hire"
```

**Subject line rules:**
```
- 40 characters max (mobile-friendly)
- No ALL CAPS
- No excessive punctuation (!!!)
- No spam trigger words (FREE, ACT NOW)
- Test with and without personalization
- Preview text matters too (use it)
```

**Preview text (preheader):**
```
- 90-130 characters
- Complements subject line
- Adds context or teases content
- Never repeats subject line

EXAMPLE:
Subject: "What's your real cost-per-hire?"
Preview: "Most calculations miss 60% of the actual cost. Here's what you're not counting."
```

---

### Step 3: Write the Opening

**First sentence earns the second. No wasted words.**

**Opening formulas:**
```
THE DIRECT ADDRESS:
"Your hiring process is taking too long. I'll explain why—and what to do about it."

THE QUESTION:
"How long did your last driver hire take? 60 days? 90 days? Longer?"

THE STORY:
"Last week, I talked to a fleet manager who'd been trying to fill a seat for 4 months."

THE STAT:
"The average fleet takes 84 days to hire a driver. 84 days of empty seats."

THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
"I know your inbox is full of companies claiming they can fix your hiring.
Here's why we're different:"
```

**Opening rules:**
```
- No "I hope this email finds you well"
- No "I wanted to reach out"
- No "As a leader in..."
- Get to the point in first sentence
- Create immediate relevance
```

---

### Step 4: Write the Body

**Every sentence must earn its place.**

**Body structure for newsletters:**
```
[HOOK - Why this matters now]

[MAIN CONTENT - The value]
- Insight 1
- Insight 2
- Insight 3

[TAKEAWAY - What to do with this]

[CTA - Soft ask]
```

**Body structure for nurture:**
```
[HOOK - Connect to their situation]

[PROBLEM - The pain they're feeling]

[SOLUTION HINT - What's possible]

[PROOF - Data or example]

[CTA - Clear next step]
```

**Body structure for announcements:**
```
[NEWS - What's new]

[WHY IT MATTERS - For them]

[HOW IT WORKS - Brief]

[CTA - Try it / Learn more]
```

**Formatting rules:**
```
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- White space is your friend
```

---

### Step 5: Write the CTA

**One email = one CTA. Maximum two if absolutely necessary.**

**CTA formulas:**
```
THE BUTTON:
[See How It Works]
[Book Your Demo]
[Get Started Free]

THE TEXT LINK:
"Click here to see the full breakdown."
"Ready to see it in action? Book a quick call here."

THE REPLY:
"Reply to this email with 'demo' and I'll send you available times."

THE SOFT:
"Worth exploring? Here's where to start: [link]"
```

**CTA rules:**
```
- One primary CTA per email
- Make the action crystal clear
- Button for marketing emails
- Text link for personal-feeling emails
- Low friction (15-min call > 1-hour meeting)
```

---

### Step 6: Write the Signature

**Signature builds trust and adds personality.**

**Standard signature:**
```
—
[Name]
[Title]
Uptime

P.S. [Optional: Second hook or CTA]
```

**Personal signature (from founder/team member):**
```
—
[Name]

P.S. Real question: What's your biggest hiring frustration right now?
     Hit reply—I read every response.
```

**P.S. line uses:**
```
- Restate the CTA differently
- Add urgency or scarcity (if genuine)
- Ask a question to prompt reply
- Share a bonus resource
```

---

### Step 7: Validate

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Subject line compelling?** Would you open this?
- [ ] **Preview text optimized?** Complements subject line
- [ ] **Opening hooks immediately?** No fluff
- [ ] **Body delivers value?** Earns the read
- [ ] **One clear CTA?** Obvious next step
- [ ] **Proper length?** Matches email type
- [ ] **Mobile-friendly?** Short paragraphs, scannable
- [ ] **Uptime voice?** Direct, helpful, confident
- [ ] **No spam triggers?** Clean copy
- [ ] **Personalization working?** [Name] fields replaced

### Value Hook Paragraphs
```
"The average fleet takes 84 days to hire a driver. That's 84 days of
empty seats, burned-out drivers covering gaps, and revenue disappearing.
There's a better way."

"Here's a number most fleets don't calculate: $1,200. That's what
every empty driver seat costs you per day. Not recruiting costs—
vacancy costs. The trucks that aren't moving."

"Your ATS isn't working. I'm not being dramatic—the data is clear.
Traditional hiring tools weren't built for driver recruitment.
And fleets are paying the price."
```

### CTA Sentences
```
"Ready to see it in action? Book a 15-minute call here."
"If you're curious, I put together a quick explainer here."
"Reply 'demo' and I'll send you some time options."
"Worth exploring? Start here: [link]"
```

### Closing Lines
```
"Your trucks don't have to sit idle."
"There's a better way. Let me show you."
"Hiring should run like the rest of your fleet."
"Your next driver is 14 days away."
```
