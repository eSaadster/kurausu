# Problem-Solution Headlines Workflow

**Creates hero copy, value propositions, and section headers using Uptime's problem-first approach.**

---

## Purpose

This workflow generates headlines that make fleet managers stop scrolling. The secret: make them feel the problem before you offer the solution. When they nod at the problem, they're ready to hear the answer.

**Use for:**
- Landing page hero sections
- Section headers throughout pages
- Ad headlines (Google, LinkedIn, Meta)
- Email subject lines
- Value proposition statements

## The Uptime Headline Architecture

### Three-Part Structure

```
PART 1: IDENTITY/SITUATION
Establish common ground. Show you understand their world.
→ "Your fleet runs on systems."

PART 2: THE EXCEPTION/PROBLEM
The twist. The thing that's broken.
→ "Except hiring."

PART 3: THE CONSEQUENCE/IMPLICATION
Why it matters. The cost of this gap.
→ "That's the problem."
```

### Full Example:
**"Your fleet runs on systems. Except hiring. That's the problem."**

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Understand the Context

**Gather information:**
1. **Page/section purpose:** What is this headline for?
2. **Audience segment:** Fleet managers? Drivers? Executives?
3. **Funnel stage:** Awareness? Consideration? Decision?
4. **Adjacent content:** What comes before/after this headline?

**Output:**
```
CONTEXT:
- Purpose: [Hero section for homepage / Feature section / etc.]
- Audience: [Fleet manager at 50+ truck company]
- Stage: [Awareness - first touch]
- Placement: [Above the fold, first thing they see]
```

---

### Step 2: Identify the Problem Stack

**Work through the problem layers:**

```
SURFACE PROBLEM (What they say):
→ "We can't find enough drivers"

REAL PROBLEM (What's actually happening):
→ "Our recruiting process is inefficient and expensive"

ROOT CAUSE (Why it exists):
→ "We're chasing individual drivers instead of building a system"

COST OF INACTION (What it's costing them):
→ "$1,200/day per parked truck"
```

**Select the problem level that matches your funnel stage:**
- Awareness → Surface or Real Problem
- Consideration → Real Problem or Root Cause
- Decision → Cost of Inaction

### Step 3: Generate Headline Variations

**Create 5 headline options using different structures:**

#### Structure A: Identity-Exception-Consequence
```
[Your world]. [The exception]. [The cost].
→ "Your fleet runs on systems. Except hiring. That's the problem."
```

#### Structure B: Question-Answer
```
[Provocative question]? [Direct answer].
→ "Why are your trucks parked? It's not a driver shortage. It's a system shortage."
```

#### Structure C: Contrast
```
[What you do] vs. [What you should do].
→ "Stop chasing drivers. Build a pipeline."
```

#### Structure D: Data-Led
```
[Shocking stat]. [What it means].
→ "$1,200 a day. That's what each parked truck costs you."
```

#### Structure E: Direct Challenge
```
[Bold statement]. [Proof].
→ "Your ATS is a $50k/year suggestion box. Here's what actually works."
```

### Step 4: Add Subheadline

**Subheadline delivers the solution with proof:**

```
FORMULA:
[Solution name] is the [category reframe] you [emotional hook]. [Speed proof]. [Guarantee].

EXAMPLE:
"Uptime is the CDL Hiring OS you should have had all along. 14-day driver delivery. Guaranteed."
```

**Subheadline variations:**
- Speed-focused: "First driver in 14 days. Guaranteed."
- Ease-focused: "Installs in one day. Runs forever."
- Risk-focused: "No match, no charge."
- Outcome-focused: "Fill your empty seats. Stop the bleeding."

---

### Step 5: Create Supporting Line (Optional)

**One sentence that bridges to the CTA:**

```
FORMULA:
[Simple benefit]. [Simple benefit]. [Outcome].

EXAMPLES:
"Installs in one day. Integrates with your team. Runs forever."
"No contracts. No minimums. Just drivers."
"Your pipeline. Your drivers. Your terms."
```

---

### Step 6: Validate Against Uptime Voice

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Problem-first?** Does the headline acknowledge pain before promising gain?
- [ ] **Specific?** Are there numbers or concrete claims?
- [ ] **Direct?** No hedging words ("might", "could", "help")?
- [ ] **Punchy?** Short sentences, strong rhythm?
- [ ] **Credible?** Claims are believable and provable?
- [ ] **Actionable?** Clear what to do next?

**Red flags to fix:**
- Starting with "Uptime helps..." → Flip to problem-first
- Vague claims → Add specific numbers
- Long sentences → Break into short punches
- Generic terms → Replace with Uptime vocabulary
