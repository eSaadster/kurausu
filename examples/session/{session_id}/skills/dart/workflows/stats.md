# Illustrated Statistics Workflow

**Single striking statistics illustrated as visual data points using Klaus aesthetic and the 3-style system.**

Creates **ILLUSTRATED STAT CARDS** — one number/statistic made visual using Japanese Precision or Sumi-e Ink styles with HIGH negative space (ma 間).

---

## Purpose

Illustrated statistics turn data points into memorable visuals. These are **single-stat cards** — one striking number with a small illustration showing what it means, designed for newsletters and social media.

**Use this workflow for:**
- Newsletter "by the numbers" sections
- Social media stat cards
- Quick visual facts
- Data highlights
- "78% of developers use AI daily" style visuals
- Attention-grabbing numbers

## Visual Aesthetic: 4-Style System for Stats

**Recommended styles:** Ligne Claire (primary) or Watercolor

### Style Selection

**Ligne Claire (For clean, punchy stats):**
- Crisp number typography
- Clean icon illustration
- Flat colors for clarity
- HIGH NEGATIVE SPACE (50-60%)

**Watercolor (For softer, emotional stats):**
- Number with subtle wash background
- Gentle illustration accents
- Soft edges create atmosphere
- HIGH NEGATIVE SPACE (50-60%)

### Core Characteristics
1. **Number dominant** — The statistic is the hero (60-70% of visual)
2. **Massive typography** — Large bold number immediately visible
3. **Small illustration** — Style-appropriate visual showing what stat represents
4. **Context text** — Brief description of what number means
5. **HIGH negative space** — 50-60% empty for breathing room
6. **Square or horizontal** — Social/newsletter friendly
7. **Scannable** — Number jumps out immediately

## Color System for Stats

### Number Typography
```
Lawn Green #7CFC00 — Primary number (most common)
OR
Maastricht Blue #002233 — Alternative bold number
```

### Illustration
```
Maastricht Blue #002233 — Small illustration linework
Lawn Green #7CFC00 — Accents on illustration
Tea Green #D7FEB2 — Alternative accents
```

### Background
```
Honey Dew #F6FFED — Warm neutral
OR
White #FFFFFF — Clean modern
```

### Text
```
Charcoal #2D2D2D — Context description text
```

### Color Strategy
- Number in purple (brand emphasis) or black (classic)
- Illustration primarily black with purple accents
- Background light for contrast
- Keep it simple: 2-3 colors total

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Select Statistic

**Identify the data point:**

1. **What's the statistic?**
   - The exact number and metric
   - Must be striking or surprising

2. **What does it represent?**
   - Context explanation
   - Why it matters

3. **What tiny illustration shows it?**
   - Simple visual representing what stat measures
   - Not complex scene, just small icon/illustration
   - Should clarify or amplify the meaning

**Output:**
```
STATISTIC: [Number + unit, e.g., "78%", "$2.1B", "3.5X"]
METRIC: [What's being measured]

CONTEXT: [What this number represents]

ILLUSTRATION: [Small visual element, e.g.:]
- "Tiny developer at computer" for developer stat
- "Stack of coins" for money stat
- "Growing arrow" for growth stat
- Size: 20-30% of image, simple, not detailed
```

---

### Step 2: Design Stat Card Layout

**Plan the visual:**

1. **Number placement:**
   - Center dominant (number in middle)
   - Left number, right illustration
   - Top number, bottom illustration

2. **Number size:**
   - How large can it go
   - Should fill 50-60% of image height

3. **Illustration placement:**
   - Where relative to number
   - How it interacts with number (near, below, beside)

4. **Text placement:**
   - Metric description above or below number
   - Context note if needed

**Output:**
```
LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- Number: [Placement, e.g., "Center dominant"]
- Size: [60% of image height]
- Illustration: [Placement, e.g., "Bottom right, 25% of image"]
- Metric text: [Above number]
- Context: [Below number in smaller text]

VISUAL RELATIONSHIP:
[How number and illustration interact, e.g.:]
- "78%" in massive purple
- Small illustrated developer sitting on top of "%" symbol
- Text above: "of developers"
- Text below: "use AI tools daily"

COLOR SCHEME:
- Number: Purple (#7CFC00)
- Illustration: Black linework with purple accents
- Background: Light cream
- Text: Charcoal
```

---

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

### Prompt Template

```
Illustrated statistic card in editorial style.

STYLE REFERENCE: Data visualization, stat card, number + icon illustration

BACKGROUND: [Honey Dew #F6FFED / White #FFFFFF] — flat, clean

AESTHETIC:
- Number as dominant visual element (massive typography)
- Small simple illustration providing context
- Hand-drawn imperfect number rendering (not digital font)
- Editorial flat color with strategic purple emphasis
- Scannable, immediate impact

STAT CARD STRUCTURE:

NUMBER TYPOGRAPHY (Advocate Block Display - MASSIVE):
"[STATISTIC]"

- Font: Advocate style extra bold, hand-lettered
- Size: MASSIVE — 60-70% of image area
- Color: [Lawn Green #7CFC00 / Maastricht Blue #002233]
- Style: Hand-lettered with imperfections (wobbly lines, character)
- Position: [Center / Left / Top]
- Example: "78%" in giant purple hand-lettered numbers

METRIC TEXT (Concourse Sans - Medium):
"[what the stat measures]"

- Font: Concourse geometric sans-serif
- Size: Medium readable (15-20% of number size)
- Color: Charcoal (#2D2D2D)
- Position: [Above / Below number]
- Example: "of developers" above the 78%

CONTEXT TEXT (Advocate Condensed - Small):
"[additional context]"

- Font: Advocate condensed
- Size: Small (10-15% of number size)
- Color: Charcoal (#2D2D2D)
- Position: [Below number / Bottom of card]
- Example: "use AI tools daily" below the number

ILLUSTRATION (Small, Simple):
[Describe the tiny illustration, e.g.:]
- Small hand-drawn [icon/figure]
- Hand-drawn black (#002233) linework
- Purple (#7CFC00) accents on [specific elements]
- Position: [Bottom right / Next to number / etc.]
- Size: 20-30% of image area
- Style: Simple sketch, not detailed
- Represents: [What the stat is about]
- Example: "Tiny developer sitting at computer with code on screen"

VISUAL INTERACTION:
[How illustration and number relate, e.g.:]
- Illustration positioned [near/on/beside] the number
- Creates visual story: "Developer represents the 78%"
- Illustration does NOT compete with number (stays small)

COLOR USAGE:
- Number: Deep Purple (#7CFC00) OR Black (#002233)
- Illustration linework: Black (#002233)
- Illustration accents: Purple (#7CFC00) OR Teal (#D7FEB2)
- Metric/context text: Charcoal (#2D2D2D)
- Background: Light Cream (#F6FFED) OR White (#FFFFFF)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Number is HERO (dominates composition, 60-70%)
- Hand-lettered number quality (NOT digital font)
- Illustration SMALL and SIMPLE (supporting role, 20-30%)
- High contrast for readability
- Strategic purple emphasis (number OR illustration accents)
- No gradients, flat colors only
- Immediately scannable (number jumps out at thumbnail)
- Square 1:1 or horizontal 16:9 format

```

---

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Use Case | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Social media post | 1:1 | Instagram/LinkedIn friendly |
| Newsletter inline | 16:9 | Horizontal fits email width |
| Vertical mobile | 9:16 | Instagram story format |
| Balanced | 1:1 | Works everywhere |

**Default: 1:1 (square)** — Most versatile for social/newsletter

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output /path/to/stat-card.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** nano-banana-pro (excellent for rendering numbers clearly)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/stat-card.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Number dominant** — Statistic is 60-70% of visual, immediately visible
- [ ] **Readable number** — Clear even at thumbnail size
- [ ] **Hand-lettered** — Imperfect, gestural quality (not digital font)
- [ ] **Illustration simple** — Small supporting visual, not complex scene
- [ ] **Context clear** — Metric/context text explains what number means
- [ ] **High contrast** — Purple or black number pops from background
- [ ] **Scannable** — Number jumps out immediately

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Number too small (should dominate)
- [ ] Digital font rendering (should be hand-lettered)
- [ ] Complex detailed illustration (should be simple icon)
- [ ] Illustration competing with number
- [ ] Low contrast (can't read number)
- [ ] Missing context (unclear what stat represents)

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Number too small | "MASSIVE hand-lettered number filling 65% of image height" |
| Looks digital | "Hand-drawn Advocate style number, wobbly imperfect strokes" |
| Illustration too complex | "SMALL SIMPLE illustration, minimal detail, 25% of image size" |
| Can't read thumbnail | Increase number size, stronger contrast |
| Unclear meaning | Add metric text above: "of [X]", context below: "[what they do]" |
| No visual interest | "Small illustrated [icon] showing what stat represents" |

## Quick Reference

**Illustrated Stat Formula:**
```
1. Select statistic (number, metric, context)
2. Design layout (number dominant, illustration placement)
3. Choose simple illustration (what stat represents)
4. Construct prompt with massive number
5. Use 1:1 square aspect ratio (usually)
6. Generate with nano-banana-pro
7. Validate for dominance and readability
```

**Color Strategy:**
- Number: Purple (emphasis) or Black (classic)
- Illustration: Black linework + purple accents
- Text: Charcoal
- Background: Light cream or white

**Key Principle:**
- **Number IS the visual** — Illustration is small supporting context
- Immediate impact, scannable at thumbnail
- Context makes meaning clear
