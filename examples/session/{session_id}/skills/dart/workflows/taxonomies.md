# Visual Taxonomies & Classification Grids Workflow

**Classification systems, taxonomies, and reference grids using Klaus aesthetic and the 3-style system.**

Creates **VISUAL TAXONOMIES** — organized classification systems like periodic tables, capability matrices, or framework grids using Japanese Precision or Textural Neobrutalism styles.

---

## Purpose

Visual taxonomies organize concepts into structured classification systems. Unlike technical diagrams (which show flows/relationships) or editorial illustrations (which use metaphors), taxonomies show **organized categories and hierarchies**.

**Use this workflow for:**
- "The Periodic Table of X"
- Classification grids and matrices
- Capability taxonomies
- Framework reference cards
- Organized typologies
- Systematic categorizations

## Visual Aesthetic: 4-Style System for Taxonomies

**Recommended styles:** Ligne Claire (primary) or Maximalism (for dense information)

### Style Selection

**Ligne Claire (Recommended for clarity):**
- Clean, uniform outlines for grid cells
- Flat, vivid colors within boxes
- Clear, architectural precision
- Easy to scan and reference

**Maximalism (For dense/rich taxonomies):**
- Dense layering of information
- Cross-hatching adds texture
- Multiple colors create visual richness
- Fills the frame with organized chaos

### Core Characteristics
1. **Grid structure** — Organized cells/boxes in systematic layout
2. **Style-appropriate execution** — Clean lines (Ligne Claire) or textured (Maximalism)
3. **Consistent typography** — 3-tier system (Advocate titles, Concourse labels, italic annotations)
4. **Category organization** — Clear groupings with visual hierarchy
5. **Color coding** — Strategic use of Lawn Green/Tea Green to show categories
6. **Klaus aesthetic** — Maintains brand colors, Maastricht Blue linework style
7. **Scannable layout** — Easy to reference and navigate

## Color System for Taxonomies

**Same UL palette, organized usage:**

### Structure
```
Black #000000 — All grid lines, cell borders, primary structure
```

### Category Differentiation
```
Crab Red #D04040 — Category 1 headers/highlights
Gold Leaf #D4AF37 — Category 2 headers/highlights
Black #000000 — All body text and labels
```

### Background
```
White #FFFFFF or Klaus Off-White #F0EAD6 — For clarity
```

### Color Strategy
- Use purple for one category type, teal for another
- Alternate colors by row/column for visual organization
- Keep most content black/charcoal with strategic color accents

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define Classification System

**Identify what you're classifying:**

1. **What is being categorized?** (e.g., AI capabilities, security threats, business models)
2. **What are the organizing dimensions?** (e.g., complexity vs. impact, offensive vs. defensive)
3. **How many categories?** (e.g., 6 types, 12 elements, 4x4 grid)
4. **What's the hierarchy?** (e.g., major categories → subcategories)

**Output:**
```
CLASSIFICATION SUBJECT: [What you're organizing]

ORGANIZING DIMENSIONS:
- Dimension 1: [e.g., Complexity: Simple → Complex]
- Dimension 2: [e.g., Impact: Low → High]

CATEGORIES:
1. [Category name] — [Description]
2. [Category name] — [Description]
3. [Category name] — [Description]
...

ITEMS TO CLASSIFY:
- [Item 1] belongs to [Category]
- [Item 2] belongs to [Category]
...
```

---

### Step 2: Design Grid Layout

**Plan the visual organization:**

1. **Layout type:**
   - Periodic table grid (rows and columns)
   - Matrix (2x2, 3x3, 4x4)
   - Hierarchical tree
   - Grouped clusters
   - Linear taxonomy (top to bottom)

2. **Cell structure:**
   - What information in each cell
   - Size of cells (uniform or varied)
   - How categories are grouped visually

3. **Color assignment:**
   - Which categories get purple
   - Which get teal
   - Pattern of color distribution

**Output:**
```
LAYOUT: [Grid type, e.g., 4x4 matrix, Periodic table style]

GRID STRUCTURE:
- [Describe arrangement: "4 rows by 4 columns, grouped by color into quadrants"]
- Cell size: [Uniform squares, varied rectangles, etc.]
- Groupings: [How categories cluster together]

COLOR CODING:
- Lawn Green: [Category type 1]
- Tea Green: [Category type 2]
- Maastricht Blue: [Remaining structure]

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Title (Tier 1): "[MAIN TITLE]"
- Category headers (Tier 2): [Category names]
- Item labels (Tier 3): [Individual items]
```

---

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

**Use 3-tier typography system:**

### Prompt Template

```
Hand-drawn taxonomy grid in editorial notebook style.

STYLE REFERENCE: Periodic table, field guide illustration, reference card aesthetic

BACKGROUND: [White #FFFFFF OR Klaus Off-White #F0EAD6] — clean, flat

AESTHETIC:
- Hand-drawn imperfect grid lines (slightly wobbly, human quality)
- Variable stroke weight (grid structure in black)
- Cell borders with slight waviness (not perfect rectangles)
- Editorial flat color aesthetic with strategic accents
- Organized layout but hand-crafted feel

LAYOUT TYPE: [Periodic table grid / Matrix / Hierarchical tree / etc.]

GRID STRUCTURE:
[Describe the grid organization, e.g.:]
- 4 rows by 4 columns of cells
- Each cell contains: [category icon/symbol] + [label text]
- Cells grouped by color into [quadrants/categories]
- Clear visual separation between category groups

TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM (3-TIER):

TIER 1 - MAIN TITLE (Advocate Block Display):
- "[TAXONOMY TITLE IN ALL-CAPS]" — Massive bold at top
- Font: Advocate style, extra bold, hand-lettered, all-caps
- Size: 3x larger than body text
- Color: Black #000000
- Example: "THE PERIODIC TABLE OF AI CAPABILITIES"

TIER 2 - CATEGORY HEADERS (Concourse Sans):
- "[Category 1]", "[Category 2]", etc.
- Font: Concourse geometric sans-serif, clean, modern
- Size: Medium readable
- Color: Crab Red #D04040 for Category 1, Gold Leaf #D4AF37 for Category 2
- Example: "Reasoning", "Creativity", "Perception"

TIER 3 - ITEM LABELS (Advocate Condensed):
- Individual items within cells
- Font: Advocate condensed, smaller
- Size: 60% of Tier 2
- Color: Black #000000
- Example: Item names, abbreviations, symbols

CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
[List all categories and items to be shown, e.g.:]

CATEGORY 1 (Crab Red #D04040 headers):
- Item A: [label]
- Item B: [label]
- Item C: [label]

CATEGORY 2 (Gold Leaf #D4AF37 headers):
- Item D: [label]
- Item E: [label]

[etc.]

COLOR USAGE:
- Maastricht Blue (#002233) for all grid structure, cell borders
- Lawn Green (#7CFC00) for [Category 1] headers and accents
- Tea Green (#D7FEB2) for [Category 2] headers and accents
- Charcoal (#2D2D2D) for all item labels and body text

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Hand-drawn sketch quality — NOT polished digital grid
- Grid lines wobble slightly (human imperfection)
- Cells roughly aligned but organic (grid-aware not grid-perfect)
- No gradients, no shadows, flat colors only
- Clear typography with 3-tier hierarchy
- Scannable and reference-friendly layout
- Strategic color coding for categories

```

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

**Choose based on taxonomy type:**

| Taxonomy Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Wide grid (many columns) | 16:9 or 21:9 | Horizontal periodictable layout |
| Tall hierarchy | 9:16 | Vertical tree structure |
| Square matrix | 1:1 | Balanced 4x4 or 5x5 grid |
| Reference card | 1:1 or 4:3 | Compact, poster-like |

**Default: 1:1 (square)** — Works for most taxonomy grids

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output /path/to/taxonomy.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** nano-banana-pro (best text rendering for labels)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/taxonomy.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

**Open the generated image and check:**

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Clear grid structure** — Organized layout with visible cells/categories
- [ ] **Readable text** — All labels legible in 3-tier hierarchy
- [ ] **Hand-drawn aesthetic** — Wobbly lines, imperfect cells, human feel
- [ ] **Strategic color** — Lawn Green/teal differentiate categories, not overwhelming
- [ ] **Scannable** — Easy to find and reference specific items
- [ ] **Hierarchical clarity** — Title > Categories > Items is obvious
- [ ] **Flat aesthetic** — No gradients, maintains UL editorial style

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Perfect straight grid lines
- [ ] Polished vector graphics
- [ ] Gradients or shadows
- [ ] Illegible or tiny text
- [ ] Color chaos (too many colors)
- [ ] Confusing organization

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Grid too perfect | Emphasize "wobbly hand-drawn grid lines, organic imperfection" |
| Text unreadable | Increase text size, strengthen typography tier requirements |
| Too colorful | "Strategic color use — purple for [specific], teal for [specific], rest black" |
| Unclear organization | Simplify grid, reduce categories, clarify groupings |
| Looks digital | Reference "hand-drawn field guide, editorial notebook aesthetic" |
