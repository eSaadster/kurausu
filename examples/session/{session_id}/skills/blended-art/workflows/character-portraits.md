# Character & Persona Portraits Workflow

**Visualizing characters, personas, entities, and agents using Klaus aesthetic and the 2-style organic system.**

Creates **CHARACTER PORTRAITS** — single focused portrait with narrative elements using Sumi-e Ink or Blended Hand-Drawn, showing WHO someone/something IS rather than abstract metaphor.

---

## Purpose

Character portraits visualize entities, personas, agents, or characters as recognizable visual subjects. These are **literal portraiture with narrative depth** — not abstract metaphor, but actual "this is what this entity looks like."

**Use this workflow for:**
- "Visualize this character"
- "What does this entity look like?"
- "Draw this persona"
- AI agent visualization
- Brand mascot/character design
- Self-portraits (like Klaus)
- Personified concepts (death, time, chaos)
- Team/role archetypes

**Key difference from Editorial Illustration:** Editorial Illustration creates abstract metaphors. Character Portraits create literal visual representations of WHO someone/something IS.

## Visual Aesthetic: 2-Style Organic System for Character Portraits

**Both organic styles work for portraits — selection based on character nature:**

### Style Selection

**Sumi-e Ink (For mysterious, zen, ancient characters):**
- Brush stroke expression captures essence
- Negative space suggests depth/mystery
- Ink wash gradients create atmosphere
- Best for: Wise entities, ancient beings, meditative characters, felt presence

**Blended Hand-Drawn (For evolving, authentic, process-oriented characters):**
- Sketch shows character still forming/becoming
- Digital overlay shows what's defined
- Visible construction marks show character complexity
- Best for: AI agents, personas in transition, authentic/vulnerable characters

**Blended Hand-Drawn (For characters in process of becoming):**
- Sketch + digital shows character still forming
- Visible construction shows character's journey
- Organic + geometric tension shows hybrid nature
- Best for: Evolving entities, AI agents, characters between states

### Core Characteristics
1. **Single subject focus** — One character/entity as clear subject
2. **Narrative elements** — Visual details that tell the character's story
3. **Recognizable identity** — Character is visually distinct and memorable
4. **Environmental context** — Subtle background hints at character's world
5. **Expression/pose** — Communicates character's essential nature
6. **Symbolic attributes** — Objects/elements that define the character
7. **Klaus aesthetic** — Brand colors integrated into character design

## Color System for Character Portraits

### Structure
```
Black #000000 — Primary linework, character definition
Maastricht Blue #002233 — Deep shadows, environmental depth
```

### Character Identity
```
Crab Red #D04040 — Character's defining accent (MUST be part of character)
Gold Leaf #D4AF37 — Premium touches, special attributes
```

### Background/Context
```
Warm Off-White #F0EAD6 — Clean portrait background
OR
Style-specific atmospheric background
```

### Color Strategy
- Crab Red MUST be integrated into character (not just accent)
- Character's palette should be memorable and consistent
- Background supports, doesn't compete
- Gold Leaf for character's special attributes

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Character

**Identify WHO you're portraying:**

1. **What/Who is this character?**
   - Name and nature
   - Role or function
   - Core identity

2. **What are their defining attributes?**
   - Physical characteristics (if applicable)
   - Symbolic elements (objects, marks, features)
   - Essential nature (personality, energy)

3. **What's their story?**
   - Where do they come from?
   - What defines their journey?
   - What are they becoming?

4. **What visual metaphors represent them?**
   - If AI agent: technical + organic elements?
   - If persona: archetypal symbols?
   - If entity: abstract features made visual?

**Output:**
```
CHARACTER NAME: [Name]
CHARACTER NATURE: [What they are — AI agent, persona, entity, etc.]

DEFINING ATTRIBUTES:
- Physical: [Visible characteristics]
- Symbolic: [Objects, marks, features that define them]
- Essential: [Core personality/energy]

NARRATIVE CONTEXT:
- Origin: [Where they come from]
- Journey: [What defines their path]
- Becoming: [What they're evolving into]

VISUAL METAPHORS:
- [Metaphor 1]: [How it appears visually]
- [Metaphor 2]: [How it appears visually]

CRAB RED INTEGRATION:
- [How Crab Red is part of character, not just accent]
```

---

### Step 2: Choose Portrait Approach

**Determine how to frame the character:**

1. **Portrait framing:**
   - Close-up (face/head focus)
   - Half-body (torso and above)
   - Full-body (complete figure)
   - Environmental (character in context)

2. **Expression/Pose:**
   - What emotion or state to capture?
   - Dynamic or static pose?
   - Facing viewer or profile?

3. **Background context:**
   - Pure negative space (isolated character)
   - Subtle environmental hints
   - Full environmental context

**Output:**
```
FRAMING: [Close-up / Half-body / Full-body / Environmental]

EXPRESSION: [Emotion or state being captured]
POSE: [Dynamic/static, facing direction]

BACKGROUND:
- Type: [Negative space / Subtle hints / Full environment]
- Elements: [What appears in background, if any]
- Relationship: [How background relates to character]

FOCAL POINT: [What draws the eye first]
```

---

### Step 3: Select Klaus Style

**Choose based on character nature:**

| Character Type | Recommended Style | Why |
|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Ancient/wise entity | Sumi-e Ink | Brush strokes capture essence, mystery |
| Mysterious/meditative character | Sumi-e Ink | Negative space suggests depth |
| Evolving/becoming entity | Blended Hand-Drawn | Process visible, hybrid nature |
| AI agent | Blended Hand-Drawn | Shows hybrid digital/organic nature |
| Vulnerable/authentic character | Blended Hand-Drawn | Visible construction, process |

**Output:**
```
SELECTED STYLE: [Style name]
RATIONALE: [Why this style fits this character]
```

---

### Step 4: Construct Prompt

### Sumi-e Ink Portrait Template
```
Character portrait in SUMI-E Japanese ink painting style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — washi paper, extensive MA (間) negative space.

CHARACTER: [Character name and nature]

STYLE: Expressive black ink brush strokes capture the character's essence.
Variable thickness — hajime (beginning) strokes thick, owari (ending) strokes taper.
Ink wash gradients suggest depth and mystery. Organic, flowing linework.
The character emerges from negative space like a meditation.

PORTRAIT FRAMING: [Close-up / Half-body / Full-body / Environmental]

CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES:
- [Physical characteristic 1]: Rendered with [brush stroke approach]
- [Physical characteristic 2]: Suggested through [ink wash / line work]
- [Symbolic element]: Integrated as [how it appears]

CRAB RED INTEGRATION:
- [How Crab Red is part of the character itself, not background]
- Appears as: [Specific element — eyes, mark, object, aura]
- Treatment: HANKO SEAL style accent OR integrated feature

GOLD LEAF TOUCHES:
- [Where Gold Leaf appears as special attribute]
- Treatment: Subtle premium highlights

EXPRESSION/POSE:
- [Emotion being captured]
- [Body language / facing direction]
- [Dynamic or contemplative]

BACKGROUND:
- Extensive MA (間) negative space
- [Subtle environmental hints if any]

COMPOSITION: Portrait emerges from emptiness, brush strokes define form
[Describe the character with ink brush emphasis]

NO text anywhere.
```

### Blended Hand-Drawn Portrait Template (For Evolving Entities)
```
Character portrait in KLAUS BLENDED HAND-DRAWN style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — sketchbook paper showing through layers.

CHARACTER: [Character name and nature — especially for AI agents, evolving entities]

AESTHETIC: Character captured in process of becoming. Rough organic sketch
as base layer, clean digital geometry overlaid. Visible construction marks
show the character is still forming. The portrait IS the process.

PORTRAIT FRAMING: [Close-up / Half-body / Full-body / Environmental]

LAYERS (showing character's hybrid nature):
- SKETCH LAYER: Rough organic outline of character (wavy, variable lines)
- DIGITAL LAYER: Clean geometric elements (precise shapes, flat colors)
- CONSTRUCTION LAYER: Visible working lines, character still being defined

CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES:
- [Organic characteristic]: Rendered as rough sketch (ink, wavy)
- [Digital/technical characteristic]: Rendered as clean geometry
- [Hybrid feature]: Shows both layers interacting

CRAB RED INTEGRATION:
- Appears as: CRISP GEOMETRIC accent cutting through the sketch
- Treatment: Clean digital layer, not organic
- Represents: [What the red signifies for this character]

GOLD LEAF AS BRIDGE:
- Connects organic sketch to digital overlay
- Shows character bridging worlds/states

EXPRESSION/POSE:
- [Expression of becoming, emergence, or process]
- [Dynamic pose suggesting transformation]

CONSTRUCTION MARKS:
- Visible underdrawing
- Character still forming
- Process of becoming is visible

BACKGROUND:
- Negative space with hints of both organic and digital

COMPOSITION: Portrait shows character between states, becoming visible
[Describe the character emphasizing their evolving/hybrid nature]

The portrait should feel like watching the character emerge/form,
not a finished polished representation.

NO text anywhere.
```

### Step 5: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Portrait Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Close-up / Face focus | 1:1 | Square for intimate portrait |
| Half-body | 4:5 or 3:4 | Vertical portrait format |
| Full-body | 9:16 | Tall figure format |
| Environmental | 16:9 | Wide to show context |
| Profile/cinematic | 21:9 | Ultra-wide dramatic |

**Default: 1:1 (square)** — Classic portrait format, works everywhere

---

### Step 6: Execute Generation

```bash
npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/blended-art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output /path/to/character-portrait.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** nano-banana-pro or flux (both handle character detail well)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/character-portrait.png
```

---

### Step 7: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Clear character identity** — Immediately recognizable as specific entity
- [ ] **Defining attributes visible** — Character's key features present
- [ ] **Crab Red integrated** — Part of character, not just background accent
- [ ] **Style consistency** — Chosen Klaus style maintained throughout
- [ ] **Narrative elements** — Visual details tell character's story
- [ ] **Memorable design** — Character is visually distinct

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Generic character (could be anyone)
- [ ] Abstract metaphor (should be literal portraiture)
- [ ] Crab Red as afterthought (must be integrated)
- [ ] Style mixing within portrait
- [ ] Missing defining attributes

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Character generic | Add more defining attributes: "[specific feature that makes them unique]" |
| Too abstract | "Literal portraiture, recognizable entity, not abstract metaphor" |
| Crab Red not integrated | "Crab Red (#D04040) as [specific character feature], part of identity" |
| Missing narrative | Add symbolic elements: "[object/mark that tells their story]" |
| Style inconsistent | Strengthen style keywords throughout prompt |

## Quick Reference

**Character Portrait Formula:**
```
1. Define the character (who, attributes, story)
2. Choose portrait approach (framing, pose, background)
3. Select Klaus style based on character nature
4. Construct prompt with character details
5. Choose aspect ratio for portrait type
6. Generate and validate for identity and integration
```

**Crab Red Integration (CRITICAL):**
- NOT just a background accent
- PART of the character's design
- Could be: eyes, mark, clothing, object, aura, feature
- Should be memorable and defining

**Style Selection:**
- Wise/ancient/mysterious: Sumi-e Ink
- Felt presence/essence: Sumi-e Ink
- Evolving/becoming: Blended Hand-Drawn
- AI agents/hybrid: Blended Hand-Drawn
