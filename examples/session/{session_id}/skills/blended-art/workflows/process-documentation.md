# Process Documentation & Working Notes Workflow

**Working process, iterations, and thinking-out-loud visuals using Klaus aesthetic and the 2-style organic system.**

Creates **PROCESS DOCUMENTATION** — multi-panel working notes showing actual iteration, refinement, and thinking process using Blended Hand-Drawn style (primary) or Sumi-e Ink.

---

## Purpose

Process documentation captures the JOURNEY of thinking, not just the polished result. These are **working notes made visual** — showing sketches, iterations, crossed-out attempts, and the messy reality of creation.

**Use this workflow for:**
- "Show me how you're thinking about this"
- "Walk me through your process"
- Visible iteration and refinement
- Thinking out loud visually
- Behind-the-scenes of creation
- Draft → refinement → insight progressions
- Authentic working documentation

**Key difference from Recipe Cards:** Recipe Cards are polished step-by-step. Process Documentation shows the ACTUAL messy working process with visible iterations, mistakes, and refinements.

## Visual Aesthetic: 2-Style Organic System for Process Documentation

**Recommended style:** Blended Hand-Drawn (primary) — this workflow was MADE for it

### Style Selection

**Blended Hand-Drawn (PRIMARY — Perfect fit):**
- Sketch layers show early thinking
- Digital overlays show refinement
- Visible construction marks = visible process
- "Work in progress" IS the aesthetic
- Authentic, unpolished, real

**Sumi-e Ink (Alternative for zen process):**
- Brush strokes show gestural thinking
- Ma (間) between iterations
- Organic flow of ideas
- Meditative process documentation

### Core Characteristics
1. **Multi-panel format** — 3-5 panels showing progression
2. **Visible iteration** — Early sketches, crossed-out attempts, refinements
3. **Construction marks** — Working lines not hidden
4. **Annotations** — Hand-written notes explaining thinking
5. **Imperfection celebrated** — Mistakes are part of the story
6. **Layered revelation** — Each panel builds on previous
7. **Authentic process** — Not polished, not perfect

## Color System for Process Documentation

### Structure
```
Maastricht Blue #002233 — Panel borders (wobbly, hand-drawn)
Black #000000 — Sketch linework, working lines
```

### Process Markers
```
Crab Red #D04040 — Key insights, "aha" moments, final refinements
Gold Leaf #D4AF37 — Bridge elements showing connection between iterations
Charcoal #2D2D2D — Annotations, thinking notes
```

### Background
```
Warm Off-White #F0EAD6 — Sketchbook paper feel
```

### Color Strategy
- Early panels: More black sketch, less color
- Middle panels: Gold Leaf bridging ideas
- Final panel: Crab Red highlighting the insight/solution
- Annotations in charcoal throughout

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Process Journey

**Identify what you're documenting:**

1. **What process are you showing?**
   - Thinking through a problem
   - Iterating on a design
   - Refining an idea
   - Discovering a solution

2. **What are the key moments?**
   - Initial sketch/attempt
   - Where you got stuck
   - The pivot or insight
   - The refinement
   - The current state (not necessarily "final")

3. **How many iterations?**
   - 3 panels: Quick process (attempt → insight → refinement)
   - 4 panels: Medium process (attempt → struggle → pivot → progress)
   - 5 panels: Full journey (attempt → struggle → insight → refinement → current)

**Output:**
```
PROCESS SUBJECT: [What you're thinking through]

JOURNEY MOMENTS:
Panel 1: [Initial attempt/sketch — what you tried first]
Panel 2: [Problem/struggle — where it broke down]
Panel 3: [Insight/pivot — the aha moment]
Panel 4: [Refinement — how you built on the insight]
Panel 5: [Current state — where you are now] (if using 5)

KEY INSIGHT: [The main learning/discovery]

VISIBLE ITERATIONS:
- [What gets crossed out or revised]
- [What thinking is visible]
- [What annotations explain the process]
```

---

### Step 2: Design Panel Progression

**Plan the visual journey:**

1. **Panel evolution:**
   - Each panel shows progression
   - Earlier panels rougher, later panels more refined
   - But ALL panels maintain hand-drawn quality

2. **Visual continuity:**
   - Same subject/concept across panels
   - Visible transformation
   - Elements carry forward (with modifications)

3. **Annotation placement:**
   - Hand-written notes in margins
   - Arrows showing connections
   - Crossed-out text for discarded ideas

**Output:**
```
PANEL LAYOUT: [Horizontal strip / Grid / Staggered]

PANEL PROGRESSION:
Panel 1: ROUGH SKETCH
- Most gestural, loosest lines
- Initial concept visible
- Annotation: "[First thought...]"

Panel 2: STRUGGLE/PROBLEM
- Crossed-out elements
- Question marks, arrows
- Annotation: "[But this doesn't work because...]"

Panel 3: INSIGHT
- Lightbulb moment visible
- New direction emerging
- Annotation: "[Wait, what if...]"
- Crab Red accent on key insight

Panel 4: REFINEMENT
- Building on insight
- More defined but still sketchy
- Annotation: "[So then...]"

Panel 5: CURRENT STATE
- Most refined (but not polished)
- Still shows construction
- Annotation: "[Where I am now...]"

CONTINUITY ELEMENTS:
- [What carries through all panels]
- [What transforms between panels]
```

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

### Blended Hand-Drawn Template (PRIMARY)
```
Process documentation in KLAUS BLENDED HAND-DRAWN style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — sketchbook paper, working surface.

AESTHETIC: Working notes made visual. Sketch + digital fusion showing actual
thinking process. Visible iterations, crossed-out attempts, refinements.
This is NOT polished documentation — it's authentic working process.

PANEL STRUCTURE: [Number] panels arranged [horizontally/in grid]
- Panel borders: Hand-drawn wobbly lines, slightly irregular
- Each panel shows iteration/progression
- Earlier panels rougher, later panels more refined
- ALL panels maintain sketch quality

LAYERS (coexisting, showing process):
- SKETCH LAYER: Rough working drawings, variable line weight
- ANNOTATION LAYER: Hand-written notes explaining thinking
- REVISION LAYER: Crossed-out elements, arrows, question marks
- REFINEMENT LAYER: Crab Red accents on key insights

PANEL 1 — INITIAL ATTEMPT:
[Describe the first sketch/attempt]
- Roughest, most gestural linework
- Early thinking visible
- Annotation: "[First thought or approach]"
- Color: Primarily black sketch

PANEL 2 — STRUGGLE/PROBLEM:
[Describe where it broke down]
- Crossed-out elements showing what didn't work
- Question marks, frustrated annotations
- Annotation: "[What went wrong or got stuck]"
- Color: Black with some frustrated marks

PANEL 3 — INSIGHT/PIVOT:
[Describe the aha moment]
- New direction emerging from old
- Lightbulb quality, energy shift
- Annotation: "[The realization]"
- Color: Crab Red (#D04040) accent on key insight

PANEL 4 — REFINEMENT:
[Describe building on the insight]
- More defined but still sketchy
- Construction marks still visible
- Annotation: "[How this developed]"
- Color: Gold Leaf (#D4AF37) bridging elements

PANEL 5 — CURRENT STATE: (if using 5 panels)
[Describe where things stand now]
- Most refined but NOT polished
- Still shows working quality
- Annotation: "[Where I am now / next questions]"
- Color: Crab Red accents on key elements

CONSTRUCTION MARKS THROUGHOUT:
- Visible underdrawing in all panels
- Crossed-out text and images
- Arrows connecting ideas across panels
- Hand-written annotations in margins
- Question marks, exclamation points
- Gestural emphasis marks

COLORS:
- Black (#000000) for all sketch linework
- Crab Red (#D04040) for insights, key moments, final elements
- Gold Leaf (#D4AF37) for bridges, connections between ideas
- Charcoal (#2D2D2D) for all annotations
- Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) background

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Process is VISIBLE (not hidden behind polish)
- Iterations are CELEBRATED (not erased)
- Mistakes are PART OF THE STORY
- Annotations explain THINKING (not just labeling)
- Final panel is CURRENT STATE (not necessarily "finished")
- Hand-drawn quality throughout (even final panel)
- NO text in the actual art (annotations are hand-lettered, not typed)

The image should feel like looking at someone's actual working sketchbook,
not a polished presentation of steps.
```

### Sumi-e Ink Alternative (For Zen Process)
```
Process documentation in SUMI-E ink painting style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — washi paper feel.

AESTHETIC: Meditative working process. Brush strokes show gestural thinking.
MA (間) between iterations creates breathing room. Organic flow of ideas
from rough to refined.

[Similar panel structure but with brush stroke progression
 from wild/gestural to more controlled/focused]

Key difference: More negative space, more zen meditation on process
```

---

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Panel Count | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 3 panels horizontal | 21:9 | Wide strip for quick process |
| 4 panels horizontal | 21:9 | Wide strip with more detail |
| 5 panels horizontal | 21:9 | Extended journey |
| 4 panels grid (2x2) | 1:1 | Square balanced grid |
| 5 panels staggered | 16:9 | Organic arrangement |

**Default: 21:9 (horizontal strip)** — Classic process documentation format

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/blended-art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 21:9 \
  --output /path/to/process-doc.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** nano-banana-pro (handles multi-panel + annotations well)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/process-doc.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Multi-panel progression** — Clear journey from start to current
- [ ] **Visible iteration** — Crossed-out elements, refinements obvious
- [ ] **Construction marks** — Working lines not hidden
- [ ] **Hand-written annotations** — Thinking explained in the image
- [ ] **Blended Hand-Drawn aesthetic** — Sketch + refinement layers visible
- [ ] **Authentic process feel** — Looks like real working notes
- [ ] **Crab Red on insights** — Key moments highlighted

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Polished, finished appearance (should feel "in progress")
- [ ] Hidden construction (working marks should show)
- [ ] Clean, perfect lines (should be gestural, wobbly)
- [ ] Typed annotations (should be hand-lettered)
- [ ] Recipe Card polish (this is messy process, not clean steps)

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too polished | "Rough working sketches, visible construction lines, imperfect" |
| No iteration visible | "Crossed-out elements, arrows showing revisions, multiple attempts" |
| Annotations missing | "Hand-written thinking notes in margins: '[thought process]'" |
| Doesn't feel authentic | "Real sketchbook working notes, not presentation" |
| Missing insights | "Crab Red (#D04040) accent on aha moment in panel [X]" |

## Quick Reference

**Process Documentation Formula:**
```
1. Define the process journey (moments, iterations, insight)
2. Design panel progression (rough → refined but not polished)
3. Plan visible iterations (crossed-out, arrows, revisions)
4. Add thinking annotations (hand-written notes)
5. Construct prompt with Blended Hand-Drawn template
6. Generate with 21:9 aspect ratio
7. Validate for authentic working process feel
```

**Color Strategy:**
- Early panels: Black sketch, minimal color
- Insight panel: Crab Red accent
- Bridge elements: Gold Leaf
- Annotations: Charcoal
- Final: Crab Red on key elements

**Key Principle:**
- **Show the work, not just the result**
- Iterations are celebrated, not hidden
- Authentic > polished
- Process > product
