# Emotional Landscape & Feeling Map Workflow

**Mapping emotional journeys, felt states, and affective terrain using Klaus aesthetic and the 2-style organic system.**

Creates **EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPES** — flowing, organic visualizations of how something FEELS, using Sumi-e Ink (primary) or Blended Hand-Drawn style.

---

## Purpose

Emotional landscapes map the FEELING of something — not what it IS structurally, but how it FEELS experientially. These are **affective terrain maps** — showing emotional journeys, felt states, and inner weather.

**Use this workflow for:**
- "How does this feel?"
- "Map the emotional arc"
- "What's the felt experience?"
- Emotional journey visualization
- User experience feeling maps
- Inner state landscapes
- Affective terrain of a concept
- Mood mapping

**Key differences:**
- **vs Conceptual Maps:** Those map IDEAS territorially, this maps FEELINGS organically
- **vs Frameworks:** Those are structural, this is felt
- **vs Timelines:** Those track time, this tracks emotional shifts

This is about SENSATION, not STRUCTURE.

## Visual Aesthetic: 2-Style Organic System for Emotional Landscapes

**Recommended styles:** Sumi-e Ink (primary) or Blended Hand-Drawn

### Style Selection

**Sumi-e Ink (PRIMARY — Perfect for feeling):**
- Brush strokes express emotional intensity
- Ink wash gradients show mood shifts
- MA (間) negative space as emotional breathing room
- Organic, flowing, felt

**Blended Hand-Drawn (For complex/layered feelings):**
- Sketch shows raw, unprocessed feeling
- Digital overlay shows recognized/named emotions
- Layers show feeling complexity
- Construction marks show emotions still forming

**Watercolor approach within Sumi-e (For soft transitions):**
- Transparent washes bleed into each other
- Colors mix at emotion boundaries
- Soft, atmospheric, immersive

### Core Characteristics
1. **Organic terrain** — Hills, valleys, currents, not boxes or zones
2. **Flow and gradient** — Emotions blend, don't have hard edges
3. **Intensity variation** — Dense/sparse, high/low, sharp/soft
4. **Embodied metaphor** — Feelings as landscape (weight, warmth, texture)
5. **Journey possible** — Can trace emotional path through terrain
6. **NOT structural** — No boxes, no grids, no frameworks
7. **Felt truth** — Represents sensation, not analysis

## Color System for Emotional Landscapes

### Emotional Intensity
```
Crab Red #D04040 — HIGH INTENSITY emotions (passion, anger, urgency, crisis)
Gold Leaf #D4AF37 — WARM emotions (hope, connection, comfort, transition)
Black #000000 — HEAVY emotions (grief, weight, depth, seriousness)
```

### Atmosphere
```
Ink Gray #4A4A4A — NEUTRAL zones, ambiguity, uncertainty
Light Ink #8A8A8A — FADING emotions, distant feelings
Warm Off-White #F0EAD6 — SPACE, breathing room, calm
```

### Color Strategy
- **Crab Red = Heat** — Where feelings are most intense
- **Gold Leaf = Warmth** — Transitional, hopeful zones
- **Black = Weight** — Heavy, deep emotional territory
- **White/Cream = Breath** — Open, calm, spacious
- Colors blend at edges (ink wash, not hard lines)

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Emotional Territory

**Identify the FEELING landscape:**

1. **What emotional experience are you mapping?**
   - A specific journey (grief process, creative arc)
   - A state (anxiety terrain, joy landscape)
   - A concept's felt quality (how trust feels)

2. **What are the emotional territories?**
   - Different zones of feeling
   - High intensity vs low
   - Dense vs sparse
   - Warm vs cold

3. **What's the emotional arc (if journey)?**
   - Where does feeling start?
   - What transitions occur?
   - Where does it resolve (or not)?

4. **What physical metaphors capture the feelings?**
   - Heavy → mountains, depths, dense strokes
   - Light → open sky, sparse marks, MA
   - Turbulent → stormy washes, chaotic strokes
   - Calm → still water, horizontal lines

**Output:**
```
EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE: [What feeling/journey being mapped]

EMOTIONAL TERRITORIES:

ZONE 1: [Feeling name]
- Intensity: [High / Medium / Low]
- Quality: [Dense, sparse, heavy, light, warm, cold, sharp, soft]
- Physical metaphor: [Mountains, ocean, mist, storm, clearing, etc.]
- Color tendency: [Crab Red / Gold Leaf / Black / Gray]

ZONE 2: [Feeling name]
- Intensity: [Level]
- Quality: [Descriptors]
- Physical metaphor: [Landscape element]
- Color tendency: [Color]

[Continue for all emotional zones]

TRANSITIONS:
- From [Zone 1] to [Zone 2]: [How the feeling shifts]
- Gradual or sudden?
- What happens at the border?

EMOTIONAL ARC (if journey):
- Start: [Beginning feeling]
- Middle: [Core experience]
- Resolution: [Where it lands, or if unresolved]
```

---

### Step 2: Design the Landscape

**Plan the emotional terrain:**

1. **Terrain type:**
   - Mountain landscape (peaks and valleys)
   - Ocean/water (currents, depths, surfaces)
   - Sky/atmosphere (clouds, weather, light)
   - Underground (depths, caves, emergence)
   - Abstract flow (currents, washes, energy)

2. **Composition:**
   - Where is intensity located?
   - Where is calm/space?
   - How do zones relate spatially?

3. **Movement:**
   - Is there a path through the landscape?
   - Does the eye journey across it?
   - Or is it immersive, centered?

**Output:**
```
TERRAIN TYPE: [Mountains / Ocean / Sky / Underground / Flow]

SPATIAL COMPOSITION:
- High intensity: [Location — center, left, rising]
- Low intensity: [Location — edges, right, descending]
- Transitional: [Location — middle ground]
- Breathing room: [Location — margins, specific areas]

MOVEMENT PATTERN:
- Path: [Left to right / Bottom to top / Circular / Immersive]
- Eye journey: [Where it starts, where it rests]

LANDMARK FEATURES:
- [Feature 1]: Represents [feeling], located [where]
- [Feature 2]: Represents [feeling], located [where]
```

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

### Sumi-e Ink Template (PRIMARY — Feeling Expressed)
```
Emotional landscape in SUMI-E Japanese ink painting style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — washi paper, the ground of feeling.

EMOTIONAL TERRITORY: [What feeling/experience being mapped]

STYLE: Expressive black ink brush strokes map emotional terrain.
This is a FEELING MAP — organic, flowing, not structural.
Ink wash gradients show emotional shifts and intensities.
MA (間) negative space as emotional breathing room.
NO boxes, no zones, no structure — pure felt terrain.

TERRAIN TYPE: [Describe the landscape metaphor]
- [Mountains / Ocean / Sky / Flow / etc.]
- Organic, hand-painted, impressionistic

EMOTIONAL ZONES (rendered as terrain):

[ZONE 1 — High Intensity]:
- Feeling: [Emotion name]
- Visual: [Heavy brush strokes / Dense ink / Dramatic wash]
- Location: [Where in composition]
- Color: [Crab Red #D04040 if intense passion/urgency, or Black for heavy depth]
- Stroke quality: [Thick, loaded, expressive]

[ZONE 2 — Transition]:
- Feeling: [Emotion name]
- Visual: [Ink wash gradient, mid-tones, shifting]
- Location: [Where in composition]
- Color: [Gold Leaf #D4AF37 for warmth, Ink Gray for ambiguity]
- Stroke quality: [Variable, transitioning]

[ZONE 3 — Calm/Space]:
- Feeling: [Emotion name or calm]
- Visual: [Sparse marks, extensive negative space]
- Location: [Where in composition]
- Color: [Light ink, mostly white/cream showing through]
- MA (間): Intentional emptiness, room to breathe

TRANSITIONS BETWEEN ZONES:
- [How feelings blend — ink wash gradients, not hard edges]
- [Strokes from one zone flow into another]
- [Colors mix at boundaries]

COMPOSITION:
- [Describe overall flow — horizontal, vertical, centered, asymmetric]
- [Where does the eye enter, journey, rest?]
- [What's the emotional arc of viewing this image?]

BRUSH STROKE QUALITY:
- [High intensity areas]: Thick, loaded, bold hajime strokes
- [Transitions]: Variable weight, gestural fude-atari
- [Calm areas]: Thin, trailing owari strokes, or empty

INK WASH TREATMENT:
- [Where are gradients?]
- [How does ink dilute from dense to pale?]
- [Black to gray to light to white progression]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- This is FELT, not analyzed
- Organic terrain, not structured map
- Ink washes blend emotions (no hard zones)
- MA (間) as emotional breathing room
- Brush strokes express intensity
- Physical metaphor for abstract feeling
- NO labels, NO text, NO boxes

The viewer should FEEL this image, not read it.
```

### Blended Hand-Drawn Template (For Layered/Complex Feelings)
```
Emotional landscape in KLAUS BLENDED HAND-DRAWN style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — sketchbook paper.

EMOTIONAL TERRITORY: [What complex feeling being mapped]

AESTHETIC: Emotional landscape with layered complexity. Some feelings
are raw and unprocessed (rough sketch), others are recognized and named
(clean digital overlay). The layers show emotional depth and complexity.

TERRAIN AS LAYERS:

RAW FEELING LAYER (Sketch, underneath):
- Rough, gestural, organic marks
- Unprocessed emotional territory
- Wavy, variable lines
- What you feel before you name it

RECOGNIZED FEELING LAYER (Digital overlay):
- Cleaner, more defined
- Crab Red geometric accents where feeling is intense and KNOWN
- What you can name and understand

GOLD LEAF AS INTEGRATION:
- Where raw and recognized connect
- Bridge between felt and understood
- Transitional warmth

CONSTRUCTION MARKS:
- Visible working of emotional processing
- Some feelings still being figured out
- Not all emotions resolved or clear

EMOTIONAL ZONES:
- [Zone of clear feeling]: Digital layer, defined
- [Zone of confused feeling]: Sketch layer, rough
- [Zone of processing]: Both layers visible, Gold Leaf

COMPOSITION:
- [How layers interact across the landscape]
- [Where is clarity, where is confusion]
- [Emotional journey through the layers]

The landscape shows the WORK of feeling —
not just the neat result, but the messy process.

NO text anywhere.

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Landscape Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Horizontal journey | 21:9 or 16:9 | Wide emotional arc |
| Vertical depth | 9:16 | Rising/falling feeling |
| Immersive centered | 1:1 | Contained, focused |
| Panoramic feeling | 21:9 | Epic emotional sweep |

**Default: 16:9 (horizontal)** — Good for emotional journeys

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/blended-art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output /path/to/emotional-landscape.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** flux (handles organic washes beautifully) or nano-banana-pro

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/emotional-landscape.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Organic terrain** — Landscape feels grown, not drawn
- [ ] **Emotional intensity visible** — Dense/sparse, heavy/light clear
- [ ] **Transitions blend** — No hard edges between feelings
- [ ] **MA (間) present** — Breathing room, negative space
- [ ] **Felt, not analyzed** — Evokes feeling, doesn't explain it
- [ ] **Physical metaphor works** — Terrain matches emotional quality

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Boxes or zones (too structural)
- [ ] Labels or text (feeling shouldn't need words)
- [ ] Hard edges between emotions (should blend)
- [ ] Framework structure (not a 2x2)
- [ ] Analytical feeling (should be experiential)

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too structural | "Organic terrain, ink washes, flowing brush strokes, NOT zones or boxes" |
| No emotional intensity | "Dense heavy strokes in [high emotion areas], sparse strokes in [calm areas]" |
| Hard edges | "Ink wash gradients between emotional zones, colors bleed into each other" |
| Missing MA | "Extensive negative space as breathing room, MA (間) for calm" |
| Feels analytical | "This should be FELT not READ, organic and experiential" |

## Quick Reference

**Emotional Landscape Formula:**
```
1. Define emotional territory (what feeling, what zones)
2. Design landscape (terrain type, composition, movement)
3. Assign colors to intensities (Red=intense, Gold=warm, Black=heavy)
4. Plan transitions (ink wash blends, not edges)
5. Construct prompt with organic terrain language
6. Generate with Sumi-e or Blended Hand-Drawn style
7. Validate for felt experience (not analytical)
```

**Color-Emotion Mapping:**
- **Crab Red = Intensity** — Passion, urgency, heat, crisis
- **Gold Leaf = Warmth** — Hope, transition, connection
- **Black = Weight** — Grief, depth, seriousness
- **White/MA = Breath** — Calm, space, peace

**Key Principle:**
- **Felt, not analyzed** — Experience, not explanation
- **Terrain, not framework** — Organic landscape, not structure
- **Blend, don't zone** — Emotions flow into each other
