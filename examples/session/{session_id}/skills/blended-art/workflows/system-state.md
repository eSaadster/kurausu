# System State & Moment-in-Time Workflow

**Capturing current states, snapshots, and simultaneous elements using Klaus aesthetic and the 2-style organic system.**

Creates **SYSTEM STATE SNAPSHOTS** — layered moment-in-time visuals showing what's happening RIGHT NOW in a system, using Blended Hand-Drawn (primary) or Sumi-e Ink style.

---

## Purpose

System state snapshots capture a MOMENT — not how something flows or changes, but what multiple elements look like AT THIS INSTANT. These are **visual snapshots** showing simultaneous states, decision nodes, or frozen moments.

**Use this workflow for:**
- "Capture this moment"
- "Show the current state"
- "What's happening right now"
- AI agent states at a specific moment
- Workflow snapshots (what's active, pending, complete)
- Decision nodes (multiple paths at once)
- Simultaneous activity visualization
- "Freeze frame" of complex systems

**Key differences:**
- **vs Technical Diagrams:** Those show structure, this shows CURRENT STATE
- **vs Timelines:** Those show change over time, this shows ONE MOMENT
- **vs Process Documentation:** That shows iteration, this freezes a single instant

## Visual Aesthetic: 2-Style Organic System for System States

**Recommended styles:** Blended Hand-Drawn (primary) or Sumi-e Ink

### Style Selection

**Blended Hand-Drawn (PRIMARY — Shows evolving/uncertain states):**
- Sketch shows elements still forming
- Digital overlay shows what's settled
- Captures "in flux" moments
- Visible construction marks show system complexity
- Best for: AI agent states, workflow snapshots, transition moments

**Sumi-e Ink (For zen/essential states):**
- Brush strokes show essence of each state
- Ma (間) negative space shows relationships
- Ink wash gradients show state intensity
- Best for: Meditative snapshots, essential states
- Handles visual density well
- Best for: Many simultaneous elements

**Sumi-e Ink (For zen snapshot moments):**
- Brush strokes capture essence of moment
- Negative space shows what's NOT active
- Best for: Minimal state captures, focused moments

### Core Characteristics
1. **Layered composition** — Multiple simultaneous elements visible
2. **State indicators** — Clear visual markers for different states
3. **Frozen moment** — Everything captured at same instant
4. **No flow arrows** — This is snapshot, not flowchart
5. **Depth/z-axis** — Some elements foreground, some background
6. **Activity markers** — What's active vs passive vs pending
7. **Simultaneity** — Everything happening at once, not sequence

## Color System for System States

### State Indicators
```
Crab Red #D04040 — ACTIVE elements (currently processing, live, engaged)
Gold Leaf #D4AF37 — PENDING elements (waiting, ready, queued)
Black #000000 — COMPLETE or INACTIVE elements
Charcoal #2D2D2D — BACKGROUND elements (context, infrastructure)
```

### Structure
```
Maastricht Blue #002233 — Boundaries, containers, system borders
Warm Off-White #F0EAD6 — Background
```

### Color Strategy
- **Crab Red = NOW/ACTIVE** — What's happening right now
- **Gold Leaf = PENDING** — What's about to happen or waiting
- **Black/Charcoal = STABLE** — What's complete or foundational
- Layering creates depth (foreground active, background stable)

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Moment

**Identify WHAT you're capturing:**

1. **What system/situation are you snapshotting?**
   - AI agent in operation
   - Workflow mid-execution
   - Decision point with options
   - Complex system at specific instant

2. **What are ALL the elements in this moment?**
   - Active processes
   - Pending items
   - Completed elements
   - Background context
   - Connection points

3. **What's the relationship between elements?**
   - Spatial relationships (near, far, above, below)
   - State relationships (active affects pending)
   - Hierarchical relationships (containers, contents)

**Output:**
```
MOMENT BEING CAPTURED: [What instant in time]
SYSTEM/CONTEXT: [What system or situation]

ELEMENTS IN FRAME:

ACTIVE (Crab Red) — Currently processing:
1. [Element]: [What it's doing right now]
2. [Element]: [What it's doing right now]

PENDING (Gold Leaf) — Waiting/ready:
1. [Element]: [What it's waiting for]
2. [Element]: [What it's queued to do]

COMPLETE/STABLE (Black) — Finished/foundational:
1. [Element]: [Its stable state]
2. [Element]: [Its stable state]

BACKGROUND CONTEXT (Charcoal) — Infrastructure:
1. [Element]: [Supporting role]

SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT:
- Foreground: [What's most prominent]
- Mid-ground: [Secondary elements]
- Background: [Context elements]
```

---

### Step 2: Design Layered Composition

**Plan the visual snapshot:**

1. **Layer depth:**
   - What's in front (most active/important)
   - What's in middle (related elements)
   - What's in back (context/infrastructure)

2. **State clustering:**
   - Group related elements
   - Separate by state (active zone, pending zone)
   - Or intermingle for realistic complexity

3. **Focus point:**
   - Where does the eye go first?
   - What's the "main event" of this moment?

**Output:**
```
COMPOSITION LAYERS:

FOREGROUND (Largest, most prominent):
- [Active element(s)]: [Crab Red treatment]
- Visual weight: Heaviest

MIDGROUND (Supporting elements):
- [Pending/secondary elements]: [Gold Leaf / contextual]
- Visual weight: Medium

BACKGROUND (Context):
- [Infrastructure/complete elements]: [Charcoal/muted]
- Visual weight: Lightest

FOCUS POINT: [What draws the eye first]

STATE ZONES:
- [Are elements clustered by state or intermixed?]
- [How do states relate spatially?]
```

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

### Blended Hand-Drawn Template (PRIMARY — For Uncertain/Evolving States)
```
System state snapshot in KLAUS BLENDED HAND-DRAWN style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — sketchbook paper.

MOMENT: [Describe the specific instant being captured]

AESTHETIC: Layered snapshot showing states still forming. Some elements
are sketch (uncertain/forming), some are clean digital (settled/decided).
The moment captures both certainty and uncertainty.

LAYERED COMPOSITION:

FOREGROUND (Active elements — Crab Red geometric):
[Describe active elements]
- [Element 1]: Currently [doing what], CRISP GEOMETRIC Crab Red
- Active elements are digitally clean (they're happening NOW)

MIDGROUND (Uncertain/Pending — Sketch layer):
[Describe forming/pending elements]
- [Element 1]: Still forming, rough sketch outlines
- [Element 2]: Waiting/uncertain, Gold Leaf bridging
- These elements show construction marks, not settled

BACKGROUND (Stable elements — Black linework):
[Describe infrastructure/complete elements]
- [Element 1]: Settled, clean black lines
- Context that's not changing in this moment

STATE INDICATORS:
- Crisp Crab Red geometry = ACTIVE/CERTAIN
- Rough sketch + Gold Leaf = FORMING/UNCERTAIN
- Clean black = STABLE/DECIDED
- Visible construction marks = STILL IN PROCESS

LAYERS SHOWING STATE:
- Clean digital = settled, decided, active
- Rough sketch = uncertain, forming, pending
- Both coexist in same moment

NO flow arrows. Snapshot of simultaneous states.

NO text anywhere.

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| System Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Simple snapshot (3-5 elements) | 1:1 | Square balanced view |
| Complex system (many elements) | 16:9 | Wide to show all elements |
| Vertical hierarchy | 9:16 | Tall for layered depth |
| Dense state grid | 1:1 | Square for density |
| Cinematic moment | 21:9 | Ultra-wide dramatic |

**Default: 1:1 (square)** — Works for most state snapshots

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/blended-art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output /path/to/system-state.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** nano-banana-pro (handles layered composition well)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/system-state.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Layered composition** — Clear foreground/mid/background
- [ ] **State differentiation** — Colors indicate different states
- [ ] **Crab Red on ACTIVE** — Currently processing elements in red
- [ ] **Frozen moment** — Everything simultaneous, not sequential
- [ ] **No flow arrows** — Snapshot, not flowchart
- [ ] **Simultaneity feeling** — Multiple things happening at once

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Sequence indicators (arrows showing 1→2→3)
- [ ] Flow diagram structure
- [ ] Single state (should show multiple states)
- [ ] Unclear state differentiation
- [ ] Timeline feeling (should be instant, not duration)

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Looks like flowchart | Remove flow arrows: "Snapshot with NO sequence arrows, simultaneous elements" |
| States unclear | Strengthen state colors: "Crab Red (#D04040) on active, Gold Leaf (#D4AF37) on pending" |
| No depth | Add layer description: "Foreground [X], midground [Y], background [Z]" |
| Single state only | Add more elements: "Simultaneously: [active A], [pending B], [complete C]" |
| Too sequential | Emphasize: "All elements in same frozen moment, not steps" |

## Quick Reference

**System State Formula:**
```
1. Define the moment (what instant, what system)
2. Identify all elements (active, pending, complete, background)
3. Design layered composition (foreground/mid/back)
4. Assign state colors (Red=active, Gold=pending, Black=stable)
5. Construct prompt with NO flow arrows
6. Generate and validate for simultaneity
```

**State Color Mapping:**
- **Crab Red = ACTIVE** — Happening right now
- **Gold Leaf = PENDING** — Waiting, queued, ready
- **Black = COMPLETE** — Finished, stable, foundational
- **Charcoal = CONTEXT** — Background infrastructure

**Key Principle:**
- **Snapshot, not flowchart** — Frozen moment, not sequence
- **Simultaneity** — Everything at once, not one-after-another
- **Layered depth** — Foreground/mid/back creates dimension

**The workflow: Define Moment → Identify Elements → Design Layers → Construct Prompt → Generate → Validate → Complete**
