# Narrative Branching & Choice Trees Workflow

**Story paths, choice trees, and narrative forks using Klaus aesthetic and the 2-style organic system.**

Creates **NARRATIVE BRANCH VISUALS** — tree structures with story flavor, showing paths, choices, and diverging narratives using Sumi-e Ink (primary) or Blended Hand-Drawn style.

---

## Purpose

Narrative branching visualizes STORY PATHS — not technical state diagrams, but narrative journeys with emotional weight. These are **choice trees with soul** — showing what happens if you go THIS way vs THAT way.

**Use this workflow for:**
- "Show the story paths"
- "What are the choices?"
- "If this, then what?"
- Decision consequence visualization
- Alternate timeline illustrations
- "Choose your own adventure" maps
- Life path branching
- Scenario exploration

**Key difference from Mermaid:**
- **Mermaid:** Technical state diagrams, precise notation, system logic
- **Narrative Branching:** Storytelling, emotional weight, path consequences

This is about NARRATIVE, not NOTATION.

## Visual Aesthetic: 2-Style Organic System for Narrative Branching

**Recommended styles:** Sumi-e Ink (primary) or Blended Hand-Drawn

### Style Selection

**Sumi-e Ink (PRIMARY — Organic narrative flow):**
- Brush strokes flow like rivers of possibility
- Paths branch organically, not geometrically
- Negative space represents unknown futures
- Expressive, emotional branching

**Blended Hand-Drawn (For uncertain/forming narratives):**
- Sketch shows paths still forming
- Some paths clearer than others
- Construction marks show narrative still being written
- Perfect for "what might happen" uncertainty

### Core Characteristics
1. **Organic tree structure** — Branches feel like growing, not technical
2. **Story nodes** — Each branch point has narrative meaning
3. **Path differentiation** — Different paths have different visual weight
4. **Consequence hints** — Branches suggest where they lead
5. **Root/origin point** — Clear starting point for the story
6. **NOT technical notation** — Story flavor, not state diagram
7. **Emotional resonance** — Paths have feeling, not just logic

## Color System for Narrative Branching

### Structure
```
Black #000000 — Primary branches, trunk of the tree
Maastricht Blue #002233 — Deeper branches, explored territory
```

### Path Differentiation
```
Crab Red #D04040 — PRIMARY PATH or CRITICAL CHOICE (the important one)
Gold Leaf #D4AF37 — ALTERNATE PATHS or CONSEQUENCES
Charcoal #2D2D2D — Path labels, narrative annotations
```

### Background
```
Warm Off-White #F0EAD6 — Paper/canvas, unknown futures
```

### Color Strategy
- Trunk and main branches in black
- Crab Red on the PRIMARY narrative path or most critical choice
- Gold Leaf on alternate paths or outcomes
- Background represents the unknown/unwritten

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define the Narrative Structure

**Identify the story you're branching:**

1. **What's the origin point?**
   - Starting situation
   - The moment before choices

2. **What are the major branch points?**
   - Key decisions or forks
   - Moments where paths diverge
   - 2-4 major branch points is ideal

3. **What are the paths?**
   - Where does each branch lead?
   - What's the narrative flavor of each path?
   - Which path is PRIMARY (gets Crab Red)?

4. **What are the endpoints (if any)?**
   - Outcomes, destinations, consequences
   - Or: paths leading into unknown (off-edge)

**Output:**
```
NARRATIVE ORIGIN: [Starting point of the story]

BRANCH POINTS:
1. [First fork]: "[Decision or divergence]"
   - Path A: [Where it leads] — [narrative flavor]
   - Path B: [Where it leads] — [narrative flavor]

2. [Second fork]: "[Decision or divergence]"
   - Path A leads to: [outcome]
   - Path B leads to: [outcome]

[Continue for all major branches]

PRIMARY PATH (Crab Red): [Which path is highlighted as main/important]

ENDPOINTS:
- [Path leads to]: [Consequence/outcome]
- [Path leads into]: Unknown (off-edge)

NARRATIVE TONE: [Epic/intimate, serious/playful, certain/uncertain]
```

---

### Step 2: Design the Tree Structure

**Plan the visual narrative:**

1. **Tree orientation:**
   - Top-down (origin at top, outcomes at bottom)
   - Bottom-up (origin at bottom, outcomes rise)
   - Left-to-right (origin at left, time flows right)
   - Radial (origin at center, paths spread outward)

2. **Branch style:**
   - Organic (like a real tree, curving)
   - Rivers (like water branching)
   - Paths (like walking trails forking)
   - Roots (like underground networks)

3. **Node representation:**
   - Small illustrations at decision points
   - Symbolic icons for outcomes
   - Or: pure branch lines with subtle markers

**Output:**
```
TREE ORIENTATION: [Top-down / Bottom-up / Left-right / Radial]

BRANCH STYLE: [Organic tree / Rivers / Paths / Roots]

VISUAL METAPHOR:
- Branches feel like: [Growing things / water / trails / etc.]
- Origin point looks like: [Trunk / source / starting path]
- Branch points show: [Forks / splits / divergences]

NODE REPRESENTATION:
- Decision points: [How they're marked]
- Outcomes: [How they're shown]
- Unknown futures: [How paths trail off]

WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION:
- Primary path: Thickest, Crab Red
- Major alternates: Medium, Gold Leaf
- Minor branches: Thinner, Black
```

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

### Sumi-e Ink Template (PRIMARY — Organic Narrative)
```
Narrative branching tree in SUMI-E Japanese ink painting style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — washi paper, the unknown future.

NARRATIVE: [What story is being branched]

STYLE: Expressive brush strokes form organic branching paths.
Variable thickness — main trunk thick, branches taper as they spread.
This is NARRATIVE BRANCHING, not technical diagram.
Paths feel like growing, flowing, or forking — not geometric.
MA (間) negative space represents unknown/unwritten futures.

TREE STRUCTURE:

ORIGIN POINT (Bottom/Left/Center):
- [Describe the starting point]
- Thickest brush stroke, rooted
- Clear beginning of the story

PRIMARY PATH (Crab Red #D04040):
- [Describe the main narrative path]
- Thick brush strokes with Crab Red accent/fill
- Most prominent visual path
- Leads to: [outcome or continues off-edge]

BRANCH POINT 1:
- [Describe the first fork in the story]
- Where: [Location in composition]
- Fork into: [Path A description] AND [Path B description]
- Visual: Brush stroke splits into two flowing lines

ALTERNATE PATHS (Gold Leaf #D4AF37):
- [Describe secondary paths]
- Thinner than primary, Gold Leaf accents
- Lead to: [outcomes or unknowns]

BRANCH POINT 2 (if applicable):
- [Describe second fork]
- Further branching from earlier paths
- Creates tree-like complexity

MINOR BRANCHES (Black only):
- [Smaller possibilities]
- Thinnest strokes, trailing off
- Suggest more paths than fully drawn

ENDPOINTS/OUTCOMES:
- [Path 1 leads to]: [Visual representation of outcome]
- [Path 2 leads into]: Unknown (brush stroke fades into MA)
- [Path 3 leads to]: [Visual representation]

COMPOSITION:
- Origin: [Position — bottom/left/center]
- Spread: [How paths fill the space]
- MA (間): Unknown futures as negative space
- Organic, asymmetric, flowing

NARRATIVE FLAVOR:
- Paths feel alive, not mechanical
- Brush strokes suggest possibility, not certainty
- Each branch has emotional weight

NO text labels (narrative is in the form, not words).
NO geometric/technical notation.
NO straight lines or rigid structure.
```

### Blended Hand-Drawn Template (For Uncertain Narratives)
```
Narrative branching tree in KLAUS BLENDED HAND-DRAWN style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — sketchbook, narrative being written.

NARRATIVE: [What story is being branched — particularly uncertain/forming]

AESTHETIC: Story paths as sketch + digital layers. Some paths are
clearly defined (digital, certain), others are still forming (sketch, uncertain).
Visible construction marks show the narrative is still being written.

TREE STRUCTURE:

ORIGIN POINT:
- Rough sketch of starting situation
- Not fully defined — story is in motion

CERTAIN PATHS (Crisp digital, Crab Red #D04040):
- [Describe paths that are clear/decided]
- Clean geometric lines (digital layer)
- Crab Red accent on primary certain path

UNCERTAIN PATHS (Sketch layer, Gold Leaf bridge):
- [Describe paths still forming]
- Rough, wavy sketch lines
- Gold Leaf hints at possibility
- Construction marks visible

BRANCH POINTS:
- Where certain meets uncertain
- Forks show some clarity, some ambiguity
- Sketch bleeds into digital and back

UNKNOWN FUTURES:
- Paths trail off into rough sketch
- Construction lines suggest more branches
- Not fully rendered — still possible

This tree is being drawn as you watch.
The narrative isn't finished.

NO text labels.
```

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Tree Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Vertical tree (origin at bottom) | 9:16 or 3:4 | Tall for upward growth |
| Horizontal flow (left to right) | 16:9 or 21:9 | Wide for temporal flow |
| Radial (origin at center) | 1:1 | Square for symmetry |
| Spreading branches | 16:9 | Wide to show breadth |

**Default: 16:9 (horizontal)** — Good for narrative flow left-to-right

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/blended-art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output /path/to/narrative-tree.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** flux or nano-banana-pro (handles organic forms well)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/narrative-tree.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Organic structure** — Branches feel grown, not drawn with rulers
- [ ] **Clear origin** — Starting point obvious
- [ ] **Path differentiation** — Primary path (Crab Red) stands out
- [ ] **Narrative flavor** — Feels like story, not state diagram
- [ ] **Branch points visible** — Where paths diverge is clear
- [ ] **Klaus aesthetic** — Style consistent, colors correct

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Technical notation (boxes, diamonds, arrows)
- [ ] Rigid geometric structure (flowchart)
- [ ] Text labels (narrative in form, not words)
- [ ] Straight lines (should be organic)
- [ ] State diagram feeling (should be story)

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too technical | "Organic branching like tree/river, NOT flowchart or state diagram" |
| No narrative feeling | "Story paths with emotional weight, each branch has consequence" |
| Rigid structure | "Brush strokes flow and curve, asymmetric, organic composition" |
| Primary path unclear | "Crab Red (#D04040) on PRIMARY narrative path, thickest stroke" |
| Missing origin | "Clear origin point at [position], trunk/root/source of story" |

## Quick Reference

**Narrative Branching Formula:**
```
1. Define narrative structure (origin, branches, paths, outcomes)
2. Design tree structure (orientation, style, weight)
3. Identify primary path (Crab Red) vs alternates (Gold Leaf)
4. Construct prompt with NARRATIVE flavor (not technical)
5. Generate with organic style
6. Validate for story feeling (not diagram)
```

**Color Strategy:**
- **Crab Red = PRIMARY PATH** — The important one, the taken one
- **Gold Leaf = ALTERNATE PATHS** — Other possibilities
- **Black = STRUCTURE** — Trunk, main branches
- **Negative space = UNKNOWN** — Unwritten futures

**Key Principle:**
- **Narrative, not notation** — Story feeling, emotional weight
- **Organic, not geometric** — Branches grow, don't snap at angles
- **Consequence visible** — Each path suggests where it leads

**The workflow: Define Narrative → Design Tree → Construct Prompt → Generate → Validate → Complete**
