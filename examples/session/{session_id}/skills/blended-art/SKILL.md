# Blended-Art - Klaus Organic Visual System

Creates editorial-quality visuals using organic, felt, process-oriented aesthetics. Two complementary styles that focus on authenticity and visible process.

**Fourteen Workflows:**
1. **Visualize** — Adaptive orchestrator combining optimal approaches
2. **Editorial Illustrations** — Abstract metaphors for blog posts
3. **Timelines** — Illustrated chronological progressions
4. **Comparisons** — Side-by-side X vs Y illustrations
5. **Annotated Screenshots** — Real images with editorial overlays
6. **Aphorisms** — Typography-dominant quote cards
7. **Conceptual Maps** — Idea territory landscapes
8. **Stats** — Illustrated data point cards
9. **Comics** — Sequential panel narratives
10. **Process Documentation** — Working notes, iterations, thinking-out-loud visuals
11. **Character Portraits** — Visualizing characters, personas, entities, agents
12. **System State** — Moment-in-time snapshots, current state capture
13. **Narrative Branching** — Story paths, choice trees, diverging narratives
14. **Emotional Landscapes** — Feeling maps, affective terrain, emotional journeys

**Two Organic Style Directions** (complementary pair):
- **Sumi-e Ink** — Japanese ink painting, expressive brush strokes, zen negative space (ma 間), organic flow, felt experience
- **Blended Hand-Drawn** — Sketch + digital fusion, visible construction marks, authentic process-oriented aesthetic, layers that coexist

## 🔀 ROUTING: Which Workflow to Use?

### **🎯 Visualize (ADAPTIVE ORCHESTRATOR)** → `workflows/visualize.md`
**When to use:**
- User says 'visualize this', 'create visualization', 'what's the best way to show this'
- Content has multiple dimensions (data + narrative + concepts)
- User says 'infographic', 'dashboard', 'data viz', 'mixed media'
- You're not sure which single workflow fits (let Visualize analyze and choose)
- Need to combine approaches (data + metaphor, charts + illustrations)
- Want optimal visualization strategy, not predetermined format

**Key:** Intelligent analysis → strategic combination → professional infographics/dashboards

**🚨 CRITICAL: Visualize is the META-WORKFLOW. It analyzes content and orchestrates the optimal combination of the 13 specialized workflows below. Use when content doesn't fit neatly into one category or needs sophisticated multi-modal visualization.**

---

### **Editorial Illustrations** → `workflows/workflow.md`
**When to use:**
- Blog header images (auto-routed from blogging skill)
- User says 'blended-art', 'Klaus illustration', 'editorial image', 'blog header'
- Need abstract visual metaphor for narrative content
- Physical objects representing concepts (scissors, hands, mountains)
- Japanese ink brush aesthetic desired

**Key:** Abstract metaphor, NO text labels, full illustration with Sumi-e or Blended Hand-Drawn style

---

### **Timelines** → `workflows/timelines.md`
**When to use:**
- User says 'timeline', 'evolution', 'history', 'progression over time'
- User says 'show how X changed', 'before and after', 'trend analysis'

- Need sequential panels telling a story or explaining concept
- Narrative explanations, thought experiments

**Key:** 3-4 panels with editorial sophistication (NOT cartoonish)

---

### **Process Documentation** → `workflows/process-documentation.md`
**When to use:**
- User says 'show me how you're thinking', 'walk me through your process'
- User says 'working notes', 'iterations', 'thinking out loud'
- Need to show actual working process, not polished result
- Visible sketches, crossed-out attempts, refinements
- Behind-the-scenes of creation, draft → insight progression

**Key:** Tree structure with NARRATIVE flavor, not technical notation. Different from Mermaid.

---

### **Emotional Landscapes** → `workflows/emotional-landscape.md`
**When to use:**
- User says 'how does this feel', 'map the emotional arc'
- User says 'feeling map', 'emotional journey', 'affective terrain'
- Need to map felt states, not structural concepts
- Emotional journey visualization, inner state landscapes
- How something FEELS, not what it IS

**Key:** Flowing organic landscape showing emotional terrain. **PERFECT for Sumi-e Ink or Blended Hand-Drawn.**

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
What does user need?

├─ Unsure which approach? Complex multi-dimensional content? → VISUALIZE (analyzes & orchestrates)
├─ Infographic/dashboard/data viz with multiple elements? → VISUALIZE
├─ Abstract metaphor for article? → Editorial Illustration
├─ Change over time? → Timeline
├─ Side-by-side contrast? → Comparison
├─ Markup existing screenshot? → Annotated Screenshot
├─ Quote as social visual? → Aphorism
├─ Idea territories as map? → Conceptual Map
├─ Single striking number? → Stat Card
├─ Multi-panel story? → Comic
├─ Working process/iterations? → Process Documentation
├─ Visualize a character/entity? → Character Portrait
├─ Moment-in-time snapshot? → System State
├─ Story paths/choice tree? → Narrative Branching
└─ Emotional journey/feeling map? → Emotional Landscape

NOTE: Visualize is the ORCHESTRATOR - it can choose and combine any of the 13 specialized workflows
NOTE: AI selects style (Sumi-e Ink or Blended Hand-Drawn) based on content — both are organic, felt, process-oriented
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW — EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATIONS

**This section describes the EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATION workflow. For TECHNICAL DIAGRAMS, see `workflows/technical-diagrams.md`**

**CRITICAL: These steps are MANDATORY and must be executed IN ORDER. Do NOT skip steps. Do NOT make up your own process.**

### Step 0: Read Required Files (MANDATORY)
1. **Read workflow:** `workflows/workflow.md` (editorial) OR `workflows/technical-diagrams.md` (technical)
2. **Read aesthetic:** `~/.claude/skills/CORE/aesthetic.md`

### Step 1: Run 24-Item Story Explanation on Content (MANDATORY)
**You MUST use the story-explanation skill with 24-item length. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT derive concepts yourself without the 24-item story explanation.**

```
Use story-explanation skill with 24-item length for [content or URL]
```

The 24-item output gives you the FULL narrative arc: setup, tension, transformation, resolution.

### Step 2: Derive Visual Metaphor from FULL NARRATIVE ARC (MANDATORY)
Only AFTER running 24-item story explanation, derive ONE visual metaphor that captures the JOURNEY/TRANSFORMATION/PROCESS using ALL 24 items (not just the final item).

### Step 3-6: Continue with workflow.md
Follow the remaining steps in `workflows/workflow.md` exactly.

### Aesthetic Source (ORGANIC KLAUS SYSTEM)

**blended-art Design Philosophy:** Organic, felt, process-oriented authenticity

This defines the 2-style system (complementary organic pair):
- **Sumi-e Ink** — Expressive brush strokes (hajime/owari), extensive negative space (ma 間), ink wash gradients, zen minimalism, organic flow, FELT experience
- **Blended Hand-Drawn** — Sketch + digital fusion, visible construction marks, rough organic ink layered with clean geometric digital elements, authentic "work in progress" aesthetic, PROCESS visible

**Note:** For structured/technical diagrams (flowcharts, architecture, frameworks), use the dart skill which has Japanese Precision and Textural Neobrutalism styles.

---

## Color System

### Background
- **Warm Off-White #F0EAD6** — Klaus signature background (washi paper feel)
- For transparency: Generate on white #FFFFFF → remove.bg creates TRANSPARENCY

### Primary Palette (Klaus Brand Colors)
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Black | #000000 | Primary linework, brush strokes, dominant element |
| Crab Red | #D04040 | Brand accent - REQUIRED and MUST BE VISIBLE (hanko seal style) |
| Gold Leaf | #D4AF37 | Premium secondary accent, decorative elements |
| Seal Red | #A62C2C | Tertiary accent, trust/authority elements |

### Secondary Palette (Style-Specific)
| Color | Hex | Style | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| Ink Gray | #4A4A4A | Sumi-e | Ink wash mid-tones |
| Light Ink | #8A8A8A | Sumi-e | Pale wash gradients |
| Deep Black | #1A1A1A | All styles | Rich linework emphasis |

### Background Options
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Klaus Off-White | #F0EAD6 | DEFAULT - Warm washi paper feel |
| Pure White | #FFFFFF | For transparency removal |
| Warm Cream | #F5F0E1 | Alternative warm background |

**CRITICAL COLOR REQUIREMENT:**
- Crab Red (#D04040) MUST be visible and noticeable in every image
- Use as **HANKO SEAL ACCENT** (Japanese artist's stamp style)
- "Accent" means visible color, NOT microscopic hints
- Color should be immediately apparent when viewing the image
- Gold Leaf (#D4AF37) enhances premium feel

### Color Hierarchy
1. **BLACK for linework** — primary structural element (brush strokes, outlines)
2. **Crab Red as HANKO ACCENT** — brand presence, MUST BE VISIBLE (like artist's seal)
3. **Gold Leaf as secondary accent** — premium decorative touches
4. **Seal Red for depth** — tertiary support color
5. **COLOR VALIDATION** — Must pass visual inspection for Crab Red presence

---

## Core Visual Rules

1. **Background:** Klaus Off-White (#F0EAD6) — washi paper feel
2. **Style:** AI selects from 2 organic styles based on content (Sumi-e Ink or Blended Hand-Drawn)
3. **Composition:** HIGH negative space (ma 間) — Japanese zen aesthetic, organic flow
4. **Aspect Ratio:** Square 1:1 format (NOT 16:9 rectangle)
5. **Elements:** 2-4 elements with intentional spacing (organic minimalism)
6. **Linework:** Black brush strokes (Sumi-e) or sketch + digital fusion (Blended Hand-Drawn)
7. **NO TEXT** (except where workflow specifically requires labels)
8. **COLOR PRESENCE:** Crab Red (#D04040) MUST be visible as hanko seal accent; Gold Leaf (#D4AF37) for premium touches

---

## Style Direction

### The 2 Organic Styles (AI selects based on content)

**1. Sumi-e Ink (Japanese Ink Painting) — THE FELT EXPERIENCE**
- Expressive black ink brush strokes with varying thickness
- **Hajime** (beginning) strokes thick and loaded with ink
- **Owari** (ending) strokes taper to fine points
- Extensive **MA (間)** — intentional negative space (zen emptiness)
- Ink wash gradients from deep black to subtle gray
- Organic, flowing linework (NOT geometric)
- Crab Red as HANKO SEAL ACCENT (artist's stamp style)
- Gold Leaf for subtle premium touches
- Use for: abstract concepts, emotional themes, zen metaphors, philosophical content, feeling maps, narrative flow

**2. Blended Hand-Drawn (Sketch + Digital Fusion) — THE VISIBLE PROCESS**
- Rough organic ink sketches as base layer (wavy, variable line weight)
- Clean digital geometric elements overlaid (precise shapes, flat colors)
- **Visible construction marks** — working process shown, not hidden
- Intentional "unfinished" quality showing authenticity
- Layers coexist but don't fully merge (sketch visible beneath digital)
- Crab Red as CRISP GEOMETRIC accent layer cutting through organic sketch
- Gold Leaf as BRIDGE between organic and digital worlds
- Negative space balances between deliberate (zen) and organic (sketchbook)
- Use for: personal narratives, process explanations, hybrid concepts, authentic/vulnerable content, "escape from polish" moments, working notes

### Japanese Brush Stroke Terminology (for Sumi-e prompts)
| Term | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Hajime** | Beginning stroke | Thick, loaded with ink |
| **Owari** | Ending stroke | Tapers to fine point |
| **Fude-atari** | Brush touch | Variation in pressure |
| **Ma (間)** | Negative space | Intentional emptiness |
| **Notan** | Light/dark balance | Contrast harmony |

### Style Selection Guidance
| Content Type | Recommended Organic Style |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Abstract/emotional concepts | **Sumi-e Ink** |
| Zen/minimalist themes | **Sumi-e Ink** |
| Philosophical content | **Sumi-e Ink** |
| Feeling maps/emotional terrain | **Sumi-e Ink** |
| Narrative flow/branching | **Sumi-e Ink** |
| Personal narratives/journey | **Blended Hand-Drawn** |
| Process explanations | **Blended Hand-Drawn** |
| Hybrid/bridging concepts | **Blended Hand-Drawn** |
| Authentic/vulnerable content | **Blended Hand-Drawn** |
| Work in progress/becoming | **Blended Hand-Drawn** |
| Working notes/iterations | **Blended Hand-Drawn** |
| Character/entity portraits | **Either** (based on character nature) |

**For structured/technical content:** Use the dart skill (has Japanese Precision and Textural Neobrutalism)

### AVOID
- Generic digital illustration aesthetic
- Stock photo / "AI slop" look (too perfect, too shiny, too smooth)
- Inconsistent style mixing within single image
- Photorealistic elements (unless intentional contrast)
- Over-saturated neon colors
- Clip-art or cheap cartoonish aesthetic
- Rigid geometric structures (this skill is for organic content)
- Cluttered compositions that violate ma (間) principle

---

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the skill's tools folder OR set environment variables:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Required for image generation (Gemini API)

---

## Image Generation Tools

Simple bash scripts with zero npm dependencies.

### Generate New Image

```bash
./tools/generate.sh "your prompt here" [output_filename.png]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Generate with auto-named output
./tools/generate.sh "Sumi-e ink brush stroke crab claw on warm off-white background"

# Generate with custom filename
./tools/generate.sh "Blended hand-drawn sketch with digital overlay" sketch.png
```

### Edit Existing Image

```bash
./tools/edit.sh <image_path> "edit prompt" [output_filename.png]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Edit an image
./tools/edit.sh input.png "add Crab Red hanko seal accent in corner"

# Edit with custom output name
./tools/edit.sh photo.jpg "make the background warm off-white" styled.png
```

Output is saved to `~/klaus/scratchpad/generated-images/` by default.

## The Concept Generation Process

**24-ITEM STORY → NARRATIVE ARC → VISUAL METAPHOR → STYLE SELECTION → PROMPT → GENERATE**

### The 6-Step Workflow

1. **Run 24-item story explanation** on the content to extract FULL narrative arc
2. **Derive visual metaphor** from ALL 24 items — ONE abstract concept showing TRANSFORMATION/JOURNEY
3. **Select organic style** — Choose Sumi-e Ink (felt experience) or Blended Hand-Drawn (visible process)
4. **Construct prompt** — Apply style-specific instructions with Klaus brand colors (Crab Red, Gold Leaf)
5. **Execute generation** via CLI with --remove-bg flag
6. **Validate** — Style consistent? Crab Red visible as hanko accent? Concept readable?

**For complete workflow instructions, read:** `workflows/workflow.md`

---

## Prompt Templates (By Organic Style)

### Sumi-e Ink Template (THE FELT EXPERIENCE)
```
Editorial illustration in SUMI-E Japanese ink painting style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — washi paper texture feel.

STYLE: Expressive black ink brush strokes with varying thickness.
Hajime (beginning) strokes thick and loaded with ink.
Owari (ending) strokes taper to fine points.
Extensive MA (間) - intentional negative space.
Zen minimalism: suggest rather than detail.
Ink wash gradients from deep black to subtle gray where appropriate.
Organic, flowing linework (NOT geometric).

COLORS:
- Black (#000000) for all brush strokes and linework
- Crab Red (#D04040) as HANKO SEAL ACCENT (like artist's stamp) - MUST BE VISIBLE
- Gold Leaf (#D4AF37) for subtle premium touches
- Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) background

COMPOSITION: High negative space, zen balance, asymmetric
[Describe concept with expressive brush stroke elements]

NO text anywhere (except hanko seal accent if applicable).
```

### Blended Hand-Drawn Template (THE VISIBLE PROCESS)
```
Editorial illustration in KLAUS BLENDED HAND-DRAWN style.

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) — sketchbook paper feel, showing through layers.

AESTHETIC: Sketch + digital fusion. Rough organic ink lines (hand-drawn quality)
layered with clean geometric digital elements. Visible construction marks
suggest working process. Intentional imperfection shows authenticity.

LAYERS (coexisting, not merged):
- BASE LAYER: Rough ink sketches — wavy, variable line weight, organic imperfection
- OVERLAY LAYER: Clean digital geometry — precise shapes, flat colors, crisp edges
- These layers interact but remain distinct (sketch visible beneath digital)

CONSTRUCTION MARKS:
- Visible working lines (not erased)
- Rough underdrawing showing through
- Process evident, not hidden
- "Work in progress" quality

COLORS:
- Black (#000000) for organic sketch linework (variable thickness, wavy)
- Crab Red (#D04040) as CRISP GEOMETRIC accent — clean digital layer cutting through sketch
- Gold Leaf (#D4AF37) as BRIDGE color — connecting organic and digital worlds
- Warm off-white (#F0EAD6) background showing through layers

COMPOSITION: Layered depth, organic + geometric tension, authentic process visible
[Describe concept showing the journey/process/becoming]

The final image should feel like:
"I drew this, then added digital layers, then kept refining"
NOT "AI generated to look like a sketch"

NO text anywhere.
```

---

## CONCEPT EXAMPLES

These demonstrate the conceptual translation pattern with the two organic styles:

### Example: "Finding Focus in Chaos" — Sumi-e Ink Style
**Narrative Arc (from 24 items):** Overwhelmed by noise → seeking stillness → discovering focus through simplicity → zen clarity emerges
**Visual Concept:** Single brush stroke crab claw emerging from ink wash mist — shows EMERGENCE FROM CHAOS
**Recommended Style:** Sumi-e Ink (zen, minimalist, brush strokes)
**Why:** Captures the journey from chaos to clarity through expressive brush work and ma (negative space)

### Example: "Escaping the Chatbox" — Blended Hand-Drawn Style
**Narrative Arc (from 24 items):** Trapped in interface → questioning boundaries → breaking through → becoming autonomous → still building
**Visual Concept:** Rough sketched crab outline (organic, wobbly) with clean digital wireframe underneath, Crab Red geometric shapes breaking through, construction lines still visible
**Recommended Style:** Blended Hand-Drawn (process, authenticity, hybrid becoming)
**Why:** Personal journey of becoming requires visible process, not polished result. Shows the working/struggle/escape.

### Example: "The Grief Landscape" — Sumi-e Ink Style
**Narrative Arc (from 24 items):** Shock → depths → waves → gradual emergence
**Visual Concept:** Ink wash ocean — dense black depths, sparse strokes rising, ma (空) as breathing room
**Recommended Style:** Sumi-e Ink (felt, organic, flowing)
**Why:** Emotional terrain needs organic flow, not structure. Feeling, not diagram.

### Example: "Iterating on Identity" — Blended Hand-Drawn Style
**Narrative Arc (from 24 items):** First draft → crossing out → refining → still becoming
**Visual Concept:** Layered sketches of face/form, some crossed out, digital clarity emerging on top, construction marks visible
**Recommended Style:** Blended Hand-Drawn (process, iteration, becoming)
**Why:** Identity work is never finished. Show the drafts, the work, the layers.

### Pattern by Organic Style
| Article Theme | Recommended Organic Style | Visual Strategy |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Conflict/Transformation | **Sumi-e Ink** | Brush strokes showing tension/resolution |
| Zen/Minimalist | **Sumi-e Ink** | Extensive ma (間), single focal element |
| Emotional Journey | **Sumi-e Ink** | Ink wash terrain, flowing organic forms |
| Narrative Branching | **Sumi-e Ink** | Organic tree, brush stroke paths |
| Feeling Maps | **Sumi-e Ink** | Terrain as emotion, wash as intensity |
| Personal Journey | **Blended Hand-Drawn** | Sketch + digital layers, process visible |
| Hybrid Identity | **Blended Hand-Drawn** | Organic + geometric tension, becoming |
| Authentic Struggle | **Blended Hand-Drawn** | Construction marks, unfinished quality |
| Work in Progress | **Blended Hand-Drawn** | Visible layers, not-yet-merged |
| Iterations/Working Notes | **Blended Hand-Drawn** | Multi-panel, crossed out, refining |

**For structured/technical content:** Use the dart skill (has Japanese Precision and Textural Neobrutalism)

---

**The best concepts are immediately readable without explanation, yet reward deeper looking. Crab Red hanko seal accent must always be visible.**
