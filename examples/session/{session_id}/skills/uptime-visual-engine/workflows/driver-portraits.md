## Driver Representation Guidelines

### Authenticity Principles
```
SHOW:
- Real working conditions
- Genuine expressions
- Professional pride
- Diverse representation
- Age range (21-65)
- Various body types
- Different ethnicities/backgrounds

AVOID:
- Overly staged/fake setups
- Forced smiles
- Stereotypical "trucker" imagery
- Exclusively young/fit models
- Lack of diversity
- Condescending portrayals
```

### Diversity Requirements
```
ACROSS ANY SET OF 4+ PORTRAITS:
- At least 1 woman
- Multiple ethnicities represented
- Age range represented
- Different truck types/settings

INDUSTRY REALITY:
- CDL-A holders: ~70% male, ~30% female (growing)
- Diverse ethnic backgrounds
- Wide age range (25-70)
- Regional variation
```

---

## Stock Photo Selection

When using stock photography:

### Approved Sources
```

- Stocksy (curated authenticity)
- Industry-specific libraries
```

### Selection Criteria
```
LOOK FOR:
- Natural expressions
- Real work environments
- Appropriate age/diversity
- Quality lighting/composition
- Not obviously staged

AVOID:
- Generic thumbs-up poses
- Perfect studio lighting
- Models who look like actors
- Same photo used everywhere
- Obvious composite images
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Generic stock look | Use editorial-quality, authentic imagery |
| Lack of diversity | Ensure representation across sets |
| Poor lighting | Natural light, golden hour preferred |
| Staged poses | Direct for natural, confident expressions |
| No environmental context | Include truck/industry elements |
| Inconsistent treatment | Apply same color grade across set |
| Missing attribution | Always include name and experience |
| Condescending tone | Treat drivers as professionals they are |
