## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Prepare the Testimonial

**Gather information:**
```
QUOTE: [The exact testimonial text]
SPEAKER: [Full name]
TITLE: [Job title]
COMPANY: [Company name]
PHOTO: [Available? What format?]
KEY METRIC: [Result achieved, if applicable]
QUOTE LENGTH: [Short (< 15 words) / Medium (15-40 words) / Long (40+ words)]
```

**Example:**
```
QUOTE: "Uptime completely transformed our hiring. We went from a 3-month
        nightmare to getting qualified drivers in two weeks. Our trucks
        are finally running at capacity."
SPEAKER: Michael Torres
TITLE: Director of Operations
COMPANY: Pacific Freight Lines
PHOTO: Yes, professional headshot
KEY METRIC: 3 months → 2 weeks (6x faster)
QUOTE LENGTH: Medium (38 words)
```

---

### Step 2: Choose Card Type

| Quote Type | Card Type | Best For |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Short, punchy | Quote Card (Text Only) | Carousels, social proof |
| With customer photo | Photo + Quote | Landing pages, trust building |
| Result-focused | Metric + Quote | ROI sections, data-driven proof |
| Impactful statement | Hero Quote | Page sections, featured testimonials |
| Multiple quotes | Social Proof Grid | Volume/quantity proof |

---

### Step 3: Edit the Quote

**Quote editing guidelines:**
```
DO:
- Keep the authentic voice
- Trim for focus (with [...] if needed)
- Highlight the result or transformation
- Ensure it's specific, not generic

DON'T:
- Change meaning or exaggerate
- Make it sound like marketing copy
- Remove specificity (numbers, timeframes)
- Use without permission
```

**Quote length by format:**
```
Short (< 15 words): Social proof grids, carousels
Medium (15-40 words): Standard cards, featured quotes
Long (40+ words): Hero quotes, case study features
```

until I saw it happen."

them back on the road in two weeks."

Uptime paid for itself in the first month."
